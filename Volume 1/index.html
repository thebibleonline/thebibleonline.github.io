            We are using Yahweh or Yahveh as the correct name. Through our research
            we have found that it is spelled both ways, and also Yahvah, all meaning
            the same thing, the TRUE NAME of THE FATHER.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            YAHWEH, the proper name of the God of Israel; it is composed of four
            consonants (YHWH) in Hebrew and is therefore called the tetragrammaton.
            (TETRAGRAMMATON, the four-lettered name for the Hebrew God pronounced
            Jehovah through misapplication, dating back to 1270, of the vowels of
            Adonai (Lord) to the consonants J, H, V, H.). The correct pronounciation
            is Yahweh.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            Also we have used many different versions of the Bible (but in all the
            versions, we are using the Correct Name). Wherever we feel it is
            necessary, we have indicated which Bible we are using by the following
            abbreviations. Otherwise, you may assume we have used the King James
            Version or the Holy Name Bible. The Holy Name Bible used the Scofield
            Reference Bible as a foundation. A full explanation of the Holy Name
            Bible, by A.B. Traina will be found on Page 107, Volume 1, of this book.
            An analysis of the True Name by Emma Zarneke will be found on page 105.

        <h3 class="text-center mb-5 mt-5 text-decoration-underline">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h3>


        <p class="text-indent">Shortly after I had received this stupendous and panoramic vision from Yahweh in 1931, I
            sat
            down with a paper tablet and pencils and attempted to put into writing that which I had seen and heard in
            the
            vision, but very shortly I abandoned my efforts for I realized that it was too much of a job for me alone to
            tackle. I did, however, manage to have charts drawn of my vision, being aided by my now deceased son, R. P.
            Kinley, and other enlightened students, and these charts have been of invaluable assistance in the
            edification
            of a fairly large number of people. These pictorial illustrations have also put to silence those who would
            say
            that I did not have a vision, for if one examines and understands the simplicity of these charts, he cannot
            help
            but come to a profound knowledge of Yahweh and His Purpose and Plan. Furthermore, these charts have been in
            the
            Universities, Colleges, Seminaries and virtually all over the world, and there has been no one to date that
            has
            been able to refute this work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">In the year of 1961, I did manage, with the incalculable contribution of a few
            dependable,
            steadfast, and devoted disciples, to get this message into print, and I am herewith doffing my hat to these
            dedicated souls.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Dr. Carl F. Gross has been my companion in the Faith for the past thirty-six years, and
            without his devoted services, I do not see how I would have made it. He is possessed of tireless patience,
            virtue not seen very often, and has the other rare quality of being able to do almost anything that one
            might
            request of him. He has labored unceasingly in getting this work into print for the second time, especially
            in
            the matter of the drawing of charts, editing and composition. Lena Gross, Dr. Gross’ secretary has been a
            constant help and encouragement.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Dr. Robert Harris, a physician, came to me in the year 1957 and has been constantly by my
            side ever since; for he soon realized the valuable role he had to play in correlating the physical body to
            the
            Divine three-fold Pattern of the Tabernacle given to Moses in Mount Sinai, proving that man is made in the
            likeness and image of Elohim. Dr. Harris’ writings are an indispensable and necessary adjunct to this work,
            and
            I greatly appreciate his noble efforts and sincere devotion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Mrs. Mary Gross is a rare person, indeed, for with tireless energy, she has typed and
            re-typed this book many times over, and has worked at a thousand other chores as my secretary. Many times I
            felt
            that she was at the point of complete physical and mental exhaustion, but somehow she would rally, and again
            tackle her many duties with renewed vigor and stamina. Words cannot express my sincere thankfulness to her
            for a
            job well done.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Dr. Dennis Droulard came to me from the Jehovah Witness faith, and their loss is my gain,
            for
            he has certainly been a boon to the publishing of this second edition of Elohim The Archetype (Original)
            Pattern
            Of The Universe. At a great personal sacrifice, he quit his job, so that he might devote his specialized
            energies to this job. It has been his know-how that has been most singularly responsible for organizing,
            editing, designing, and general managing of the multifarious job of publishing this book.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Mrs. Marion Harris, the companion of Dr. Harris, has had her hands full also, for she has
            had
            to type all of Dr. Harris’ writings, and assist Mrs. Gross with correspondence and other work. Frankly
            speaking,
            I do not see how she was able to do anything in assisting with this work, realizing the arduous role that a
            physician’s wife has to play.
        </p>

        <p class="text-indent">Dr. Bernard Durham, an accomplished pianist and musician, was added to the fold not many
            months ago, but his presence has certainly been felt by everyone. He has not only added to the joy and
            happiness of our group by his musical renditions but contributed to the work of this book by closely working
            with me in composition and typing. We would sometimes labor over one sentence for many days before we were
            satisfied with its structure. He has been of great benefit to me in this worthwhile endeavor.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">There are many others of The Institute of Divine Metaphysical Research, Inc., but space
            will not permit us here to list all the people of the Institute who have helped and the ones who have
            sincerely desired to help and be a part of this work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">I sincerely thank each and everyone of these for the valuable part that he played in
            making this volume a reality, and thereby bestowing their love upon all who will read and understand the
            message of this book.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center mb-5 mt-5 text-decoration-underline">PREFACE</h3>

        <p class="text-indent">In the eight year period since the first edition of this book, “God, The Archetype
            (Original) Pattern Of The Universe” was published in October, 1961, there have been many momentous,
            prophecy- fulfilling events and happenings to come to pass. All of these events have brought the whole world
            nearer to disaster and ruin, and have been an omen of the end of this world, and the inevitable revelation
            of Yahshua the Messiah from heaven. Men, everywhere, are fearful and trembling in anticipation of some
            devastating and cataclysmic holocaust and are hurriedly holding councils and endless meetings trying to get
            things patched up, and thereby avoid or escape their doom. They are altogether ignorant of what is happening
            in the world and why, for they know absolutely nothing of the Eternal Purpose and Plan of Yahweh. If they
            were knowledgeable of Yahweh’s Purpose and Plan, they would understand that everything that is taking place
            in the world is a fulfillment of His Words and the Scriptures contained in the Holy Bible. They would
            further understand that there is nothing that any man can do to obstruct, hinder or impede the carrying out
            of our Eternal Creator’s will and pre- determined counsel (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=23&chapter=46#v9__1">Isaiah 46:9-10</a> ).</p>
        <p class="text-indent">When one takes a good look at the present world situation, he finds that there is hardly
            any political, ecclesiastical, scientific or social institution, racial or ethnic group, or geographical
            location that has escaped involvement in the violent and turbulent changes that are transpiring in the
            world. The Roman Catholic Church, that great bastion and citadel of Christianity has fallen “flatter than a
            fritter;” the present day Roman Catholic Church would not be recognized by any of its past rulers and
            adherents if they were raised from the dead, and they would be utterly shocked to see the ruin and dismal
            decline of the once proud lady of religious demagoguery. The death of Pope Pius XII marked the end of the
            old order of religious tyrants, and ecclesiastical bondage, and the succession and reign of Pope John XXIII
            marked a transitional period in which the long held customs, tenets and traditions of Roman Catholicism
            began to shake and tremble. The convening of the Second Vatican Council on October 11, 1962, and the
            succession to the papal throne of Pope Paul VI began to put the finishing touches, and to signal the death
            knell of Christendom’s loftiest constituent. It should be categorically declared that the 1961 publication
            of “Elohim The Archetype (Original) Pattern Of The Universe” and its perusal by these Popes, Cardinals,
            Archbishops, and laity has been responsible for the profound changes that have taken place in the Roman
            Catholic Church, for this work exposed and revealed the satanic workings of this organization; and they have
            been feverishly trying to rectify the obvious errors and foolish blunders that mark their organization as
            the modern day Babylon. There is chaos and confusion, and a definite schism in the Roman Catholic Church,
            and many thousands of laymen, priests, and even Jesuits have left the ranks of the church in open defiance
            to the Pope and the ruling hierarchy, and have started underground churches. These have expressed openly
            their disgust and discontent with the Pope’s rulings on birth control, the demotion of saints, the
            participation of priests and bishops in the decision-making policies of the church, and his forbiddance of
            the priests to marry.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">All of these events have happened to the Roman Catholic Church in fulfillment of the
            prophecies of John the Revelator in his vision on the Isle of Patmos as recorded in the 17th and 18th
            chapters of the Book of Revelations. It was and is absolutely necessary that Satan be revealed or exposed
            before Yahshua the Messiah is revealed from Heaven taking flaming vengeance on those who know not Yahweh.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">The protestant faiths, too, are implicated in this religious and theological
            deceitfulness for they are guilty of the same practices and errors of the mother church. They are busily
            trying to join ranks thinking that there is strength in numbers, and they openly admit that the number of
            their divisions is appalling and disgusting. Their congregations are also dwindling and one does not have to
            go far before he finds a church building for sale, for they are suffering also from the same spiritual
            wickedness and desolation of abomination, and are being cast down.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- page -->

    <div class="page">
        <p class="text-indent">Likewise, the political organizations of the world have suffered decline and
            embarrassment and frustrations; countries have gone off of their gold standards and faced economic ruin
            while other world renown governments have been stubbornly resisted by small insignificant countries in armed
            conflict. Political heads of governments have stepped down from their high posts in disdain or been ousted
            or assassinated, and civil strife in the streets, and on the campuses of Universities is rampant, with no
            one having any answers as to why these things should be or as to the ultimate end of these upheavals.
            Nations have armed themselves to the teeth with devastating and destructive nuclear weapons, and are
            nervously watching one another in order to be the first to push the button to release these terrible
            instruments of war for they fully realize that the one that strikes first would have a decided advantage.
            So, we all sit like ducks on a dry powder keg awaiting the inevitable spark that will blow us all into total
            oblivion.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">To further add to the chaos and confusion in the world, there is strife and blood-shed
            between racial groups, the blacks versus the whites, the yellows versus the reds, the Jews versus the Arabs,
            etc. Brother is fighting against brother, father against son and mother against daughter, the young against
            the old, and everywhere there is utter chaos and disorder. The Jew-Arab situation seems to be the classical
            example of such conflict, and it is potentially explosive enough to lead the whole world into armed
            aggression. Neither the Jewish nations or the Arab nations will even mention that Yahweh in His ultimate
            Purpose and Plan gave the land of Canaan, over which they are now fighting, to both nations as an
            inheritance. They do know enough, however, to keep the United Nations out of the role of mediator for they
            fully realize that the U.N. knows nothing of the Promise made to Abraham the father of both Isaac and
            Ishmael. Both nations of people would rather fight to the last man then to give Yahweh the glory and honor
            of recognizing His Will and His Way.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">The matter of the young people and teenagers uprising needs special mentioning as these
            youngsters have come to the realization of the hypocrisy of Christendom, and of their parents and have
            openly revolted against them. They have no further confidence in the government, their church, their
            teaching institutions or their parents, and rather than to be a hypocrite, they have just given themselves
            over to whatsoever they willed. They take drugs openly and defiantly, they make love openly, they dress as
            they desire, and raise hell whenever they choose. They are not shackled by any morals, laws or religious
            dogmas. It must be said for them, that most of them are too honest to be a hypocrite.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">It is in the climate of the above-mentioned conditions that this second edition of
            “Elohim The Archetype (Original) Pattern Of The Universe,” is being published, and hopefully we are
            endeavoring to reach the masses of the people who are in the doldrums of despair and hell. No, there can be
            no drawing back from the inevitable destruction of the world for Yahweh has purposed it to be so, but it is
            possible for one to free himself from the bondage of sin and ignorance, and to come into the ark of safety
            in the glorious liberty of the Sons of Yahweh. No one in his right mind could think that the world is going
            to go on and on and that eventually, peace and harmony would prevail, for this has never been the case
            except for very short periods of time since man has been upon the face of the earth. It is the mercifulness
            of Yahweh to provide a way of escape out of this doomed world and we should be eternally grateful to Him for
            this precious salvation.</p>

            The sum total of these written volumes, expresses my true revealed “UNDERSTANDING” of Yahweh- Elohim and the
            Creation as it is recorded in the Holy Bible, and in reference to Yahshua the Messiah, the true “SON OF
            YAHWEH,”
            and Satan, or the Anti-Messiah, the true “SON OF PERDITION.” Yet, this understanding is not of my own
            private
            and independently conceived imagination. In the month of June and year of 1931, I, Henry Clifford Kinley,
            was
            caused to behold a great Panoramic Vision, and on the same day I also in turn received the Divine Revelation
            of
            Spiritual meaning of the Vision. It is this simplified Panoramic Vision and Revelation of the Divine Pattern
            of
            the Universe, given to me by Yahweh-Elohim, which I have expounded upon, through charts and writings to my
            associates which in turn has qualified them to detect, identify, and to prove the existence of Yahweh, and
            the
            Satanic Mystery of Iniquity, and to trace the Mark of the Beast from its origin to its final conclusion, the
            Lake of Fire.
        </p>

        <p class="text-indent">
            This is a more comprehensible elucidation of the first and probably the last manuscript that I will write in
            my
            lifetime, as pertaining to Yahweh and His Ultimate Purpose which has functioned down through the past and
            the
            present Dispensations and Ages, and will continue to operate through the Dispensations and Ages yet to come.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            This great and powerfully psychological experience revealed Yahweh-Elohim to me for the first time in my
            life;
            revealed Him as He really EXISTS, being the ONE and ONLY UNIVERSAL SPIRIT and ARCHETYPAL PATTERN OF THE
            UNIVERSE. In presenting and explaining this stupendous “Vision and Revelation” to you, the reader, I presume
            that YOU are honest, sincere and earnest in your extensive and intensified search for the TRUE YAHWEH OF THE
            UNIVERSE. I further assume, that you, like millions of other human beings in every walk of life throughout
            the
            world, truly want to KNOW YAHWEH our ELOHIM as He really IS and as He ACTUALLY EXISTS. Our only purpose in
            writing this book is to try to help you FIND and KNOW Yahweh our Elohim for your own personal satisfaction

            physical and spiritual. Sometimes, stopping and thinking for a moment over the essential things of life
            eliminates many regretted years of poverty, sickness, humiliation, embarrassment sometimes, death and
            destruction. Therefore, we should learn to pause and TRY TO THINK INTELLIGENTLY before we finally conclude
            affirmatively or negatively. We should do this before an ultimatum or final decision is rendered on any
            secular subject. The majority of us are, to some extent, guilty of this negligence.

            have become infinite in wisdom and infallible in judgment, or that I have already attained that state of
            absolute perfection in every technical detail. However, I am only trying to attract your attention and
            elevate your MIND so that I can impart to you the TRUE UNDERSTANDING of the Vision which I received by
            Divine Revelation. In view of this, the Pictorial Illustrations and explanations of the Vision herein set

            As heretofore stated, the REVELATION of the ARCHETYPAL PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE embraces the EXISTENCE OF
            YAHWEH, HIS UNIVERSAL SPIRIT LAW and ETERNAL PURPOSE through the Dispensations and Ages. Comparatively
            speaking, this is a new Divine, Philosophical, Scientific, Spiritual, Scriptural and Revolutionary
            “interpretation” of the Holy Bible. It is supported by a definite DIVINE PATTERN and PLAN, “descriptively”
            stipulated in the Scriptures of the Holy Bible itself (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=25#v40">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a

                2:19-21</a>). This interpretation is discretely confirmed in every polytechnical detailed manner by the
            UNIVERSAL CREATION OF ELOHIM, both corporeal and incorporeal, visible and invisible (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=45&chapter=1#v19__1">Romans 1:19-20</a>).
            Moreover, I firmly BELIEVE that this Vision and Revelation is to be regarded as ONE of the greatest and most
            astounding of PANORAMIC VISIONS and REVELATIONS ever given to mankind since the CREATION of the material or
            stellar parts of the Universe.

            To the very best of our limited artistic ability, we have drawn pictorial illustrations and charts of the
            Great Panoramic Vision, showing the “DIVINE PATTERN” and Spirit Law embodied therein, and tried hard to
            explain its true meaning to Religious Teachers, Philosophers, Scientists and Medical Doctors. No man, Jew,
            Gentile, Roman Catholic, Protestant, or Teachers of Philosophy and other Scientific or Cosmic phases of
            nature, who have HEARD and UNDERSTOOD the explanation of the “DIVINE ARCHETYPE PATTERN” and the Universal
            Spirit Law embodied therein and His operation shown by the illustrative charts, has ever been able to refute

            the Old Covenant with
            Israel. Further, this teaching INVESTIGATES the cosmographical structure of the Universe and the unexplained
            so-called Law of Nature, which in REALITY, is Universal Spirit Law, the powers latent in man, and teaches
            mankind of his INSEPARABLE relationship with Yahweh-Elohim and to have implicit “FAITH” in Yahweh-Elohim and
            worship Him in SPIRIT and in TRUTH (<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-Chapter-4/#24"
                target="_blank">John 4:24, KJV</a>); as Yahweh-Elohim had originally intended, according to
            His Eternal Purpose (<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ephesians-Chapter-1/#9">Ephesians 1:9-12,
                KJV</a>).

        <p class="text-indent">
            Furthermore, since the Scriptures teach us that man is made in the Likeness and Image of Elohim and he (the
            man) is willing to confess that he knows very little about the anatomy and physiology of his own body, which
            he has had all his life; HOW THEN could we expect him to know Yahweh-Elohim as He actually exists and as He
            really is? (See correlation of the physical body to the Divine Pattern by Robert Harris, M.D., Ph.D., D.D.,
            volume 3 in this book).

            It may seem to you that this is the long way around, but in reality it is the short way, when you STOP and
            consider that Yahweh-Elohim in His New Covenant, has promised to put His Law in our heart and write it in
            our mind and cause us to “Know Him” and walk in His Way, that is, deliver us from the Ignorance of Sin and
            Preserve us for Eternal Life and Immortal Glorification (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=24&chapter=31#v31__3">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=47&chapter=3#v1__3">II Corinthians 3:1-4</a>). Yahshua
            said, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you,
            and LEARN of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls: For my yoke is
            EASY, and my burden is LIGHT” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=11#v28__2">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).
            It is of this Vision and Revelation that you shall read in
            the succeeding pages.

            Yahshua the Messiah charged His disciples after His resurrection from the grave as a Quickening Spirit (<a

                Cor. 15:45</a>) to “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing (or immersing) them in the Name of
            the
            Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
            commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the age (or world)” - (<a

            Therefore, it has been the Holy Spirit which is Yahshua the Messiah or the Comforter (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=14#v26">John 14:26</a>) in those
            who are preaching the True Gospel of the Kingdom that has really done the preaching all down through this
            Present Age of Grace since Pentecost. We, therefore, having this ministry (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=47&chapter=4#v1__5">II Corinthians 4:1-6</a>), have had
            the awesome responsibility to see to it that “this True Gospel of Yahshua be preached in all the world for a
            witness unto all nations, and then shall the end (of the world or Age) come” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=24#v14">Matt. 24:14</a>). Accordingly, we

            (whom they call Jesus) came to set up a Christian
            example for us to follow, and that He was instituting carnal ordinances e.g., water baptism, Lord’s Suppers,
            etc., for us to follow, whereas He (Yahshua) said that He came to FULFILL such carnal ordinances (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=3#v13__2">Matthew
                3:13-15</a>; <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=5#v1">Matthew 5:1</a>,<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=5#v17__1">17-18</a>; Luke 24:44-45); of their error in saying
            that Yahshua has gone away into Heaven
            to prepare a place (the Kingdom) for us whereas, He is really tabernacling in our physical bodies as a
            quickening Spirit (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=51&chapter=1#v26__1">Colossians 1:26-27</a>). These and a
            lot of other serious spiritual errors were pointed out
            to these ecclesiastical giants and no serious denial was forthcoming from any of them. We noticed one
            particular thing throughout our journeying and that is that the common folk everywhere are hungry for the
            Real, Genuine Truth and recognize immediately when it is preached unto them, especially in some of the under
            developed countries of Africa.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            Having preached the True Gospel of Yahshua the Messiah throughout the world, we therefore know that the end
            of this world or Age is not far off since according to <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=24#v14">Matthew 24:14</a>, the end would not come until such
            time
            as it was preached. This is also a witness to the fact that Christendom and the other religious beliefs are
            not the True Gospel as they have been preached throughout the world for a long time and the end has not
            come.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            We have a further witness in the fact that our Founder, Dr. Henry Clifford Kinley, the man to whom this
            stupendous, Divine Vision and Revelation was given in the year 1931, and who preached this True Gospel for
            forty-five (45) years has now taken off the flesh as of February 9, 1976 and we all know that according to
            the Divine Purpose and Pattern that we must follow very shortly by taking off the flesh, also, as the
            Apostle Paul said, “Behold, I show you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
            moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be
            raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
            mortal must put on immortality” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=46&chapter=15#v51__2">I Corinthians
                15:51-53</a>). There is no one that is going to Heaven or Hell in
            this physical body, as flesh and blood does not inherit the Kingdom of Yahweh (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=15#v50">I Corinthians 15:50</a>). As of
            now, we are supposed to have Yahshua the Messiah who is a Quickening Eternal Spirit abiding in these mortal
            bodies and it is the Eternal Spirit that will change our vile, physical body into a glorious spiritual body
            as Yahshua the Messiah who only at this time has an Immortal Spiritual Body (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=50&chapter=3#v20__1">Philippians 3:20-21</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=54&chapter=6#v16">I Timothy 6:16</a>). Even those who have passed on have
            not obtained this glorious body but are waiting for that moment
            when they shall be changed right along with us (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=6#v9">Revelation
                6:9</a>; <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=58&chapter=11#v39__1">Hebrews 11:39-40</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            And one more thing needs to be understood and that is that Yahweh is mercifully saving a few more souls
            right in the closing prophetic moments of this age — not a great number, but a remnant, and we have seen
            this manifested as new souls are being added unto the Spiritual Body or Congregation of Yahshua the Messiah
            every day. Since it is Yahweh who is saving these souls through His Son, Yahshua the Messiah, He is opening
            up their understanding right now, and it does not take them a long time to comprehend the Truth as it did
            some of us older ones. Nevertheless, whether we come to an understanding over night or over a long period of
            time, all praises and glory and honor belong unto our Heavenly Father, Yahweh, for this blessing.

            and PURPOSE through the Dispensations and Ages. Comparatively speaking, this is a NEW and REVOLUTIONARY
            SCRIPTURAL TEACHING which embraces the fields of COSMOGONY, ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, PHILOSOPHY,
            GENERAL SCIENCE and ESCHATOLOGY, to mention only a few. This TEACHING is Spiritually transforming the CARNAL
            MIND and illuminating THE UNDERSTANDING OF MANKIND in regards to his Theological and Religious concepts of
            Yahweh-Elohim and His Purpose. It teaches mankind according to the Scriptures the TRUTH about his ORIGIN and
            INSEPARABLE RELATIONSHIP with Yahweh-Elohim, Yahshua and the Universe which he (the man) is a part thereof.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            DO NOT BE DECEIVED. Moreover, this TEACHING is definitely supported by a DIVINE PATTERN and PLAN,
            descriptively stipulated in the Scriptures of the Holy Bible and is discretely confirmed by Yahweh-Elohim
            Himself, His INCORPOREAL and CORPOREAL (invisible and visible) Universal Creation, the Law and the Prophets,
            Yahshua The Messiah, the Apostles, and in part, by modern (practical or general) Science. Likewise, this
            TEACHING exposes the adversary (Lucifer) and his MYSTICISM or FALSE so-called OCCULT SCIENCE.

            Our aim here is to lead YOU, STEP by STEP to an indisputable, profound KNOWLEDGE OF YAHWEH our ELOHIM, and a
            permanent, conscientious realization of His Universal EVER PRESENCE, in WHOM we LIVE, MOVE and HAVE OUR
            BEING, and a REALISTIC and comprehensible UNDERSTANDING of His Incorporeal and Physical manifestations
            throughout the Universe. Before this gigantic task can be Universally accomplished, that is with sincere
            appreciation, we MUST FIRST REALIZE the direct course of procedure by which the Invisible Yahweh-Elohim
            chose to CREATE the Universe and to make Himself FULLY KNOWN as HE REALLY IS and ACTUALLY EXISTS. First to
            Moses as an individual writer and thereafter to mankind collectively. Thereafter, Yahweh-Elohim chose to
            make Himself fully known from His inception, up to the present time as follows:

                It MUST BE UNDERSTOOD and REMEMBERED that this TEACHING is NOT A CONCEPT of the writer of this book, but
                is supported by ELOHIM, THE ARCHETYPE (ORIGINAL) PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE (see the title and illustration
                on the cover of this book), seen by Moses alone (in the Burning Bush and also atop Mount Sinai) who
                wrote the Pentateuch (Law). Later ELOHIM appeared to the Prophets, who wrote the books of the Prophets,
                and to the Apostles, then appeared to John alone on the Isle of Patmos who wrote Revelation and last of
                all to the writer of this book (see <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=23&chapter=46#v9__1">Isaiah 46:9,10,

                We MUST REALIZE that without a workable KNOWLEDGE and CORRECT INTERPRETATION of what is WRITTEN in the
                Law and Prophets (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=23&chapter=8#v20">Isaiah 8:20</a>), it is IMPOSSIBLE
                for you to know anything definite about Yahweh our
                Elohim and His Purpose. Therefore, Yahshua the Messiah told the Rabbinical Scribes and Pharisees of His
                day to “SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES (<span class="u">not</span> <span class="u">the</span> <span

            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST REALIZE that Yahshua the Messiah said, ”ELOHIM IS SPIRIT; and they that worship Him MUST WORSHIP
                HIM IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=4#v24">John 4:24, H.N.B.</a>).

            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST ALSO REALIZE, that the INVISIBLE things of Yahweh are SEEN and UNDERSTOOD by the VISIBLE things,
                “Because that which MAY BE KNOWN OF YAHWEH IS MANIFEST IN THEM; for Yahweh HATH SHOWED IT UNTO THEM. For
                the INVISIBLE THINGS OF HIM FROM THE CREATION OF THE WORLD ARE CLEARLY SEEN, being UNDERSTOOD BY THE
                THINGS THAT ARE MADE, EVEN HIS ETERNAL POWER and SUPERNAL NATURE; so that THEY ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE”
                (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=45&chapter=1#v19__1">Romans 1:19-20, H.N.B.</a>). For example, David
                the Psalmist said, “The Heavens declare the Glory of El:
                and the firmament sheweth His handy work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
                knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Yet their message is gone
                out through all the earth, and their story to the end of the world. In them hath He set a TABERNACLE for
                the sun” (Psalms 19th division, H.N.B.). Yahshua the Messiah said, “If I have told you earthly things,
                and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of Heavenly things” (<a
                    href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=3#v12">John 3:12, H.N.B.</a>).

            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST ALSO REALIZE, that “ALL SCRIPTURE (<span class="u">not</span> <span class="u">traditions</span>)
                that is given BY INSPIRATION OF YAHWEH, IS
                PROFITABLE FOR DOCTRINE, FOR REPROOF, FOR CORRECTION, FOR INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS: that the man of

            It cannot be reiterated too strongly how vitally important it is for you, the reader, and me, the writer, to

            the ORIGINAL INSPIRED WRITINGS, written by Moses and the Prophets by the Power of the Paternal Yahweh-Elohim

            shown to Moses and the Prophets, reveal Yahweh-Elohim operating in THE DAY or REALM OF ETERNITY, that is,
            BEFORE TIME BEGAN and manifests His activities in the past, present and future Ages, within both the
            Spiritual and Physical creation. The SCRIPTURES (not tradition) including the written REVELATION of the
            Apostle John on the Isle of Patmos, disclose Yahweh and His Purpose from the Beginning to the Ending.

            THE ERRONEOUS BELIEF CONCERNING THE SACRED RECORDS
        </h3>
        <p class="text-indent pb-5">
            It is generally believed and quite frequently taught that the Sacred Records of the Creation of Heaven and
            Earth and all that in them is, plus the GENEALOGIES OF MANKIND and the CURRENT EVENTS were uninterruptedly
            transmitted from generation to generation, from Adam to Moses. This transmission of the Sacred Records is
            thought to be possible because of the longevity of the people at that time and that the total elapsed
            chronological period reaching from Adam to the Flood is a relatively short period of 1656 years. From the
            Flood to the Exodus of Israel or to Moses represents a short chronological period of 857 years. The total
            period of time from the CREATION OF ADAM TO MOSES taking into consideration the long-life span of the
            Ante-diluvian Patriarchs and combining the chronological periods involved BEFORE the Flood and AFTER the
            Flood, represents a period of 2513 years, plus seven (7) creative days or years (with Israel) equals 2520.

        <p class="text-indent">
            The PERSONS involved in the transmission of the Sacred Records according to their theory would be the
            following: (1) ADAM, the FIRST earthly created man (whose wife was Eve) whose total life-span was 930 years,
            begat Cain and Abel and other SONS and DAUGHTERS (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=5#v4__1">Genesis
                5:4-5</a>). (2) SETH, the son of ADAM was born in the
            130th year of Adam’s life. The total life-span of Seth was 912 years. (3) ENOCH, the seventh generation from
            Adam was born in the 622nd year after the creation of ADAM and TRANSLATED in the year 987. Enoch was 365
            years old at the time of his TRANSLATION. (4) METHUSELAH, born in the 687th year of Adam’s life was 969
            years old at the time of his death in 1656 A.M., the year of the FLOOD which took place in the 600th year of
            NOAH’S life. (5) NOAH, born in the year 1056 A.M., lived a total life-span of 950 years (and begat three
            sons, SHEM, HAM and JAPHETH) which places his death in the year of 2006 A.M. or 350 years AFTER the FLOOD
            and died in the year 2158 A.M., or 1846 B.Y.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            From the partial genealogical calculation on the preceding page, we can readily SEE and UNDERSTAND that
            Methuselah was born in 687 A.M., and lived 243 years BEFORE the TRANSLATION of ENOCH, 350 years of Noah’s
            life BEFORE the Flood and also 98 years of Shem’s life BEFORE the Flood. Therefore, we can understand how
            the oral or written records could pass from ADAM through SETH, ENOCH and METHUSELAH to NOAH and SHEM in the
            Ante-diluvian Age during the 1656 years from ADAM to the Flood. Skipping the immediate descendants of SHEM,
            the Patriarch, Abraham’s vocation first began to take place about 427 years AFTER the Flood and SHEM died
            502 years AFTER the Flood, which would make the call of Abraham 75 years BEFORE the death of SHEM.
            Therefore, it is quite possible that Shem and Abraham could have become acquainted during the life time of
            Shem and received, in the Post-diluvian Age, the Sacred Records which some of the theologians claim were
            passed from Shem to Abraham.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It was to Abraham and his seed to whom Yahweh-Elohim had PROMISED the BLESSING. Ishmael was the first son of
            Abraham by Hagar, the bond woman (Gentile), and Isaac was the second son of Abraham, but he (Isaac) was the
            first and only son of ABRAHAM, by Sarah, his FIRST wife (Hebrew). (In Isaac shall thy Seed be called). After
            the death of Sarah, Abraham also had six (6) sons by his second wife KETURAH, namely: 1. Zimran, 2. Jokshan,
            3. Medan, 4. Midian, 5. Ishbak, and 6. Shuah (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=25#v1__1">Genesis
                25:1-2</a>). Jacob was the son of Isaac and the father of
            the twelve tribes of Israel whose posterity Moses led out the land of Egypt and the house of bondage, 430
            years AFTER the PROMISE was made. Therefore, from the previous enumeration one can understand why the belief
            has continued through the years that the Sacred Records were given to Abraham and were transmitted from him
            to his son, Isaac, and from Isaac to Jacob, his son, and to the twelve sons of Jacob who transmitted those
            records to Moses. This explanation, then, covers the total chronological period of 2513 years plus 7 years
            equaling 2520 years (7 years as the 7 days of creation), reaching from ADAM to MOSES.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            However, this belief of some Theologians of the transmission of the SACRED RECORDS of the Creation of Heaven
            and Earth and the current events of the Ante-diluvian Age is disputable, in part, because these Medieval and
            Modern Academically trained, Scientific and Philosophical minded Theologians see at a glance that if this
            explanation is accepted it would immediately establish ADAM as the WRITER of the Book of Genesis in which
            was RECORDED many Historical Events which occurred FIVE DAYS prior to ADAM’S creation (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v1__25">Genesis 1:1-26</a>), and
            over two thousand years AFTER his DEATH (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=5#v1__4">Genesis
                5:1-5</a>). For this reason in particular, this class of
            Theologians discard the idea that ADAM or any of the Ante-diluvian Patriarchs wrote the Book of Genesis, and
            declare MOSES to be the TRUE INSPIRED WRITER OF THE BOOK in question. This view brings to light another
            GREAT TWO-FOLD COMPLICATED QUESTION.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            If ADAM is to be rejected as the WRITER OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS on the basis that it contains many Historical
            Events which occurred FIVE DAYS BEFORE HIS OWN CREATION and also many other events which occurred OVER TWO
            THOUSAND YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH (the Book of Genesis ends with the death of Joseph), HOW then could Moses
            WRITE the HISTORY OF THE CREATION OF HEAVEN and EARTH and all that in them is, and the current Historical
            Events of the Ante-diluvian Age and a part of the events of the Post-diluvian Age, which occurred over TWO
            THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE HE WAS BORN?

            To further add to the confusion, before we even attempt to answer the great two-fold controversial question,
            we shall state here that there are some Theologians and so-called Scientifical and Biblical Critics that
            believe that there are two cosmological accounts of the Creation contained in the Book of Genesis.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            These so-called Theologians and Scientifical Biblical Critics have declared against Moses as being the
            writer of the so-called two (2) cosmogonies in the Book of Genesis. To defend their convictions, they claim
            that George Smith, Archeologist of the British Museum, unearthed Assyrian Terra-Cotta tablets at Nineveh in
            1875 A.D., which they FALSELY claim are older than Moses’ writing of the Book of Genesis in which they
            further claim, give accounts of the Creation, the Temptation, the Tower of Babel and the FLOOD, virtually
            identical with the Genesis account WHICH WE CLAIM AND PROVE WERE FIRST REVEALED TO MOSES, but they fail to
            tell us WHEN, WHERE or WHO wrote these Tablets. These Bible Critics say that the accounts of Moses were
            copied from the Babylonian account AFTER their captivity to Babylon. (See “The Bible In The Balance” by
            Charles Smith, editor of the Truth Seeker, and see also the Bible Dictionary, article on Cosmogony by Funk
            and Wagnall, page 152. Also see article on Assyro-Babylonian Mythology from Larousse Encyclopedia of
            Mythology, page 49).

        <p class="ti">
            <span class="u">THE GREAT TWO-FOLD CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION IS ANSWERED</span> IN THIS WAY: (1) Yahweh-Elohim
            appeared to the Patriarchs in the Ante-diluvian Age and some of them in the Post- diluvian Age as mentioned
            above, long before the time of Moses by the NAME OF EL SHADDI, but they never WROTE or DOCUMENTED any of
            their communications they had with Him (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=6#v3">Exodus 6:3,
                H.N.B.</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Therefore, no man on earth BEFORE Moses, or at that time, except JOSHUA, the son of NUN, Moses’ Minister
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v13">Exodus 24:13</a>, H.N.B.), knew the TRUE NAME of the
            Father, YAHWEH our ELOHIM, but Moses, ALONE to whom Yahweh
            introduced Himself at the BURNING BUSH in the Wilderness of Sinai (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=3#v2__7">Exodus 3:2-8</a>, H.N.B.). Therefore, the
            NAME, YAHWEH our ELOHIM appears in the Book of Genesis many times, which PROVES beyond question that Moses
            DID WRITE THE BOOK OF GENESIS, AFTER the EXODUS of the Israelites from Egypt (see pictures and illustrations
            on <a href="/Volume%201/index.html#v1_13">page 13</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) Let it here be known that Moses had three (3) distinct experiences with Yahweh-Elohim speaking or
            calling unto him from the Mount as follows and in this order:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            1. YAHWEH-ELOHlM (the FIRST time) called Moses up into the mount and spoke to him from out of the mount and
            gave him instructions and warnings concerning the children of Israel, giving them three days to clean up and
            gather around the mount, before He spoke and gave the Ten Commandment Law (see the 19th chapter of Exodus).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            2. YAHWEH again (the SECOND time) called Moses up into the mount in the midst of the CLOUD in which he was
            given the tables of stone with the Ten Commandment Law written thereon, showed unto him the VISION of the
            TABERNACLE and the creation of the Heavens and Earth in logical sequence of Six Solar Days, and Moses was in
            the mount forty days and forty nights (see the 24th chapter of Exodus and also Chart on Creation shown to
            Moses, page 18).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            3. YAHWEH said unto Moses (the THIRD time), Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the FIRST: and I will
            write upon these tables the words that were in the FIRST tables which thou broke. And be ready in the
            morning and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount
            (see <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=34#v1__1">Exodus 34:1-2, H.N.B.</a>). Moses went up into the
            mount, “And he was there with Yahweh forty days and
            forty nights; he did neither eat bread nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the
            covenant, the Ten Commandments” <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=34#v28">Exodus 34:28</a>, see also
            Chart on Genealogies shown to Moses his third trip,

            As the time drew near for YAHWEH-ELOHIM to make the necessary preparations to deliver the Children of Israel
            out of the land of Egypt according to the PROMISE He (as El Shaddi or the Almighty Provider) had made to
            Abraham and his Seed, or Isaac and Jacob, Yahweh-Elohim raised up Moses to deliver the Children of Israel,
            who were the posterity of Jacob, from the Egyptian bondage.

            Moses, born in Egypt of his parents, Amram and Jochebed in 1570 B.Y., at which time Pharaoh, the Egyptian
            King had instructed the midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, to destroy all the male children of the Hebrews,
            because they were multiplying faster than the Egyptians (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=1#v15__1">Exodus 1:15-16</a>). Moses’ mother, Jochebed hid and
            nursed him in her own house for three months, realizing she could hide him no longer, made an Ark and put
            him in it and placed it in the bulrushes of the River Nile, while Moses’ sister Miriam stood in a secret
            place and watched the performance. When Pharaoh’s daughter came to bathe herself in the river, she heard the
            child (Moses) cry and she retrieved him from the water and decided to keep him for herself. Moses’ sister
            Miriam approached Pharaoh’s daughter and asked her if she should get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the
            child for her. She gave her consent and agreed to pay wages to the woman to nurse him. Miriam, took Moses to
            his mother, Jochebed and she nursed him until he was weaned and thereafter she turned him over to Pharaoh’s
            daughter (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=2#v2__8">Exodus 2:2-10</a>). Therefore, Moses was reared
            up in the house of Pharaoh’s daughter and was
            acquainted with the Egyptians arts and customs. At the age of 40, Moses slew an Egyptian and hid him in the
            sand for smiting a Hebrew. After becoming aware that Pharaoh would learn what he had done, Moses fled into
            the Land of Midian in the Wilderness of Sinai and married one of the seven daughters of Jethro, Zipporah.
            Her father Jethro was a priest in Midian and also owned a flock of sheep, and Moses became a shepherd
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=2#v11__11">Exodus 2:11-22</a>).

            After Moses, the shepherd, had been in the Wilderness for forty years, Yahweh FIRST APPEARED (in a Vision),
            in the form of Elohim, as an angel, IN THE MIDST OF THE BURNING BUSH to him (Moses) with the ROD in his hand

            BUSH, Yahweh-Elohim called unto him out of the MIDST OF THE BUSH, and said, “Moses, Moses! And he said, here
            am I. And He (Yahweh-Elohim) said, Draw NOT NIGH HITHER: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the PLACE
            whereon thou standest is HOLY GROUND. Moreover He said, I am the ELOHIM of thy father, the ELOHIM of

            Moses, ALONE (while still at the BURNING BUSH in the Wilderness) was instructed to go back down into Egypt
            to speak to the Israelites and Pharaoh. Yahweh-Elohim’s further introduction and commission or instruction
            to Moses: “And Elohim said unto Moses, AYAH-ASHER-AYAH” (I WILL BE WHAT I WILL TO BE — <a

            the original Hebrew text, H.N.B., translated I AM THAT I AM in the K.J.V.). Yahweh-Elohim demonstrated to
            Moses that He would BE WHAT HE WILLED TO BE, when He commanded Moses to cast the rod, which he had in his
            hand, on the ground and it became a Serpent. Moses fled but Yahweh told him to put forth his hand and take
            it by the tail and it became a rod again. Yahweh demonstrated other miracles to Moses such as instructing
            him to “Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out,
            behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And He said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand
            into bosom again, and plucked it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh”
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=4#v2__5">Exodus 4:2-7</a>).

            said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, YAHWEH, the ELOHIM of your
            fathers, the ELOHIM of Abraham, the ELOHIM of Isaac, and the ELOHIM of Jacob hath sent me unto you: this is

            point Moses hesitated to go again into Egypt unto Pharaoh who Moses supposed was the Pharaoh (Rameses I),
            King of Egypt, that was reigning at the time when he (Moses) slew the Egyptian and fled into Midian in the
            wilderness some forty years earlier. However, Yahweh assured Moses that all the men which sought his life
            were dead, and that another Pharaoh (Rameses II - the typical man of sin or Son of Perdition of the 18th
            Dynasty - 666, see <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=13#v18">Rev. 13:18</a>), was reigning who did

            the morning of the next day after the stygian night of the Passover, Elohim by the Phenomenal Cloud and the
            hand of Moses led the twelve tribes of Israel out of the plague stricken devastated chaotic land of Egypt
            early in the morning of the third day, through the MIRACULOUSLY DIVIDED WATERS of the Red Sea into the

            On the 15th day of the second month (Zif) AFTER Israel came out of Egypt Yahweh established a SABBATH when
            He gave them MANNA to be gathered SIX DAYS and rest on the SEVENTH DAY (SABBATH - <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=16#v15__11">Exodus 16:15-26</a>). Shortly
            after Moses was called into Mount Sinai the “FIRST TIME” and was instructed of Yahweh-Elohim to sanctify the
            people against the third day (which was June 6th), thereafter, YAHWEH-ELOHIM SPOKE TO ISRAEL from the CLOUD
            that covered the Mount the Ten Commandment Law the First Covenant or Testament at which time, simultaneously
            the Law was written on tables of stone in the Mount (see Exodus 20th chapter and also Plate # 2, on page 14
            ).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Thereafter, Moses wrote all of the words of YAHWEH-ELOHIM in a Book which He had spoken from the mount, he
            (Moses) took the blood of the Sacrifices of Bullocks which he had caught in basins and sprinkled half the
            Blood upon the Altar. Then he took the Book and READ it in the audience of the people: and they said all
            that Yahweh hath said will we do, and be obedient. Moses then took the other half of the Blood and sprinkled
            it on the BOOK and on the people, and said, Behold the Blood of the Covenant, which Yahweh hath made with
            you concerning all these words; this was the First Covenant with Israel (<a

            Nadab, Abihu and the Seventy Elders of Israel and they should worship Him afar off, but Moses ALONE should
            come near Yahweh (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v1__1">Exodus 24:1-2</a>). It was there on
            the plateau of the CLOUD COVERED Mount that they saw (in a
            vision) JOSHUA, the Elohim of Israel TRANSFIGURE into the SUPER INCORPOREAL FORM OF A MAN or as a GREAT
            HEAVENLY ANTHROPOMORPHIC BEING (see <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v9__1">Exodus 24:9-10</a>,
            and compare with <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=16#v28">Matthew 16:28</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=17#v1__12">Matthew 17:1-13</a>). This
            demonstrated, revelation was made to Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the seventy elders of Israel at this TIME and
            PLACE because He wished them to know THEN and THEREAFTER that HE WAS THE ELOHIM of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
            or the Elohim of Israel, their Elohim as stated in the proceeding caption (see <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=17#v1">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a

            Thereafter, Moses and his Minister JOSHUA, rose up to ascend to the top of the Phenomenal Cloud covered
            mount to receive the two tables of stone with the Ten Commandments engraved with the finger of Elohim; but
            before Moses departed, he instructed Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the seventy elders to TARRY THERE WHERE THEY
            WERE until he and Joshua returned from the top of the CLOUD COVERED MOUNT. However, when Moses and Joshua
            DID NOT RETURN according to the Israelites expectations, they DISOBEYED Moses’ instructions and descended
            from the plateau of the mount and became engaged in making and worshipping the GOLDEN CALF, which operation
            also resulted in breaking of the Commandments of Yahweh-Elohim, written by Moses in the Book of the Covenant
            and also engraved in the two Tables of Stone, which reads as follows: “And ELOHIM spake all these words,
            saying, I am YAHWEH THY ELOHIM, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
            bondage. Thou shalt have NO ELOHIM before Me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven idol, or any likeness
            of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the
            earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I YAHWEH THY ELOHIM am a jealous ELOHIM,
            visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
            hate Me: And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and keep My Commandments” (<a

            B - THE VISION OF THE THREE-FOLD ARCHETYPAL PATTERN IN RELATION TO THE THREE-FOLD TANGIBLE SANCTUARY
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            It was also in Mount Sinai that Moses received the VISION of the three-fold Archetype Pattern in relation to
            the three-fold Tangible Sanctuary (see plate # 4 on page 16 ). The VISION of the three-fold ARCHETYPAL
            PATTERN is explained in this way: ELOHIM, the Great Heavenly Anthropomorphic Incorporeal Being,
            instantaneously TRANSFORMED HIMSELF into a three-fold COMPLETELY FURNISHED, intangible Sanctuary so that
            Moses could SEE the total structure; with its Brazen Vesseled exterior furnishings and the Golden Vesseled
            interior furnishings therein, and also the interior hanging curtains and the departmental DIVIDING VAIL,
            lavishly embellished with Angelic Figures. Thus, in this way, ELOHIM was able to SHOW Moses the three-fold
            Intangible Sanctuary and make him thoroughly UNDERSTAND and retain in his MIND, how, thereafter, he was to
            build the (figurative) three-fold Tangible Sanctuary for a Dwelling Place for Him, Elohim, among the
            children of Israel (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=25#v8">Exodus 25:8</a>), fashioned like the
            PATTERN which Moses had SEEN in the Mount (Exodus
            25:40). This was necessary since YAHWEH, in His Supernal Nature is three-fold namely: (1) YAHWEH or the
            FATHER, (2) ELOHIM or THE WORD, and (3) YAHSHUA or the HOLY SPIRIT in personification, and these THREE ARE
            ONE (<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1-John-Chapter-5/#7">I John 5:7, K.J.V.</a>), ALL IN ALL
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=46&chapter=15#v28">I Corinthians 15:28</a>) UNIVERSAL SUPREME SPIRIT
            EMBODIMENT in whom we
            live, move and have our being (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=44&chapter=17#v28">Acts 17:28</a>, see also
            <a href="#v1_17">Plate # 5 on page 17</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Therefore, the manifested TRANSFORMED STATE of the three-fold YAHWEH (Yahweh, Elohim or Yahshua), into the
            INTANGIBLE SANCTUARY or INCORPOREAL PATTERN, shown to Moses in the Mount, MUST BE three-fold or DIVIDED into
            THREE PARTS. These three parts are namely: (1) The Most Holy Place, (2) The Holy Place and (3) The Outer
            Court. This statement by John, “For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and
            the Holy Spirit: and these three are one” (<a
                href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1-John-Chapter-5/#7">1 John 5:7, K.J.V.</a>), along with
            Paul’s statement (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=51&chapter=2#v9">Colossians 2:9</a>), “For in Him (Elohim
            or Yahshua) dwelleth all the fulness of the Supernal Nature of Yahweh in bodily form (Yahshua),” PROVES the
            much debated question by Christendom who say that the Supernal Nature (Godhead) consists of three individual
            persons, who agree in one; but the Pattern of the Tabernacle, and all things created in the Universe by the
            Pattern, PROVES that there are THREE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE ONE SPIRIT: Yahweh (invisible), Elohim (visible
            in visions) and Yahshua (visible).

            THE VISION AND HISTORY OF THE CREATION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            (See <a href="#v1_19">Chart proving the Exodus BEFORE the Genesis, page 19</a>, and <a href="#v1_18">Chart #
                6, page 18</a>). We have explained Exodus
            the 24th chapter from the 1st to the 15th verses, now we shall explain the 16th verse. Moses while still in
            the Mount and within the midst of the Cloud was shown another Vision. This time, beginning with <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v16">Exodus 24:16</a>, He Elohim showed Moses a Panoramic
            Vision of the creation of Heaven and Earth. Elohim manifested Himself to Moses in an Incorporeal Form as the
            Creator of Heaven and Earth and all that in them is. Therefore, in this Vision, Moses HEARD and SAW within
            Six Solar Days, Elohim in the process of creation by Himself, the Pattern, each evening and morning or day
            by day in logical sequence until he had reached the Seventh Day. Moses wrote in <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v16">Exodus 24:16</a>, “And the Glory of Yahweh abode upon
            Mount Sinai and the CLOUD
            covered it six days: and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst the Cloud.”
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It was here at the colon, after the six days in the <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v16">24th
                chapter of Exodus and the 16th verse</a> in the year
            1490 B.Y., after Moses had led the children of Israel out of Egypt under the leadership of Yahweh- Elohim
            that Moses was called into Mount Sinai and was shown the VISION of the creation of Heaven and Earth, as is
            quoted by Moses in the first chapter of Genesis (see chart on the Exodus before the Genesis, page 19), which
            says: “In the beginning (of Moses’ Vision) ELOHIM created the Heavens and Earth.” Moses saw in the VISION in
            <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v33">Genesis 1:33, H.N.B.</a> THAT ON THE SEVENTH DAY ELOHIM
            completed His work and rested on the SEVENTH DAY from
            all His work which He had made. The record of the Creation in the first chapter is not a record of the
            actual creation but an account of Moses’ VISION which he had in Mount Sinai in the year 1490 B.B.Y. or 2513
            years (A.M.) after the first man ADAM.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            The fact that Moses was called into Mount Sinai in the year 1490 B.Y. and saw in a VISION the Creation of
            Heaven and Earth which he recorded in the first chapter of Genesis and confirmed by the three-fold Pattern
            of the Tabernacle, PROVES that the long sought mystery by Scientists, Theologians and Commentators of the
            record of the Creation, was not of Babylonian or Assyrian origin of Mythology, but was by a VISION shown to
            Moses in Mount Sinai in 1490 B.Y.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            If you will also note that Moses wrote in the 1st verse of the 2nd chapter of Genesis (H.N.B.) or the 4th
            verse of the 2nd chapter of Genesis (K.J.V.) quoted thusly: “These are the origins of the heavens and the
            earth when they were created in THE DAY (the DAY, singular) of Yahweh, the SOURCE and SUBSTANCE, in THE
            REALM OF ETERNITY, NOT IN TIME, that Yahweh-Elohim made the earth and the heavens,” having no beginning or
            ending (see chart, the Exodus BEFORE the Genesis, page 19). This vision of Moses which he SAW as related in
            the 24th chapter of Exodus in the year 1490 B.Y., and recorded in the 1st and 2nd chapters of Genesis is the
            answer to the long sought mystery by Scientists and Theologians as to how old and from what substance the
            Universe was created.

            with the finger of ELOHIM and place them in the Ark of the Covenant. “And Yahweh said unto Moses, Go, get
            thee down: for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves”
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=32#v7">Exodus 32:7</a>). After Moses received the FIRST TWO
            TABLES OF STONE, Joshua told Moses that he heard a noise

                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=32#v17">Exodus 32:17</a>). As we have already stated, Moses DID

            SEE the TRANSGRESSION in the Garden of Eden, BEFORE he and Joshua departed from the top of the cloud covered
            mount, with the FIRST two tables of stone in his hands. Arriving at the Plateau of the Mount (which was in
            seeing distance of the camp), where he (Moses) had instructed Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the Seventy Elders to
            remain or tarry until he and Joshua returned, he discovered that they had DISOBEYED his command and returned
            to the camp and had built and was engaged in worshiping the GOLDEN CALF.

            it. Moses then questioned his brother Aaron to learn the reason for the Israelite apostasy, that is their
            departure from the mount and their DISOBEDIENCE in building and worshiping the Golden Calf, which Aaron
            explained to Moses that he and Joshua did not return according to their expectations, they became impatient
            and refused to tarry any longer. Therefore, they departed from the mount and demanded that Aaron allow them
            to collect the gold from one another, build and worship the Golden Calf. Moses told the Israelites that they
            had sinned a great sin. After receiving instructions from Elohim, Moses then told the Levites to arm

            After this, Moses consecrated the rest of the people and returned unto Yahweh to make atonement or

            PRAY THEE, OUT OF THE BOOK WHICH THOU HAST WRITTEN. And Yahweh said unto Moses, “Whosoever hath sinned
            against me, him will I BLOT OUT OF MY BOOK (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=32#v32__1">Exodus

            MOSES THIRD TRIP INTO THE MOUNT
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            Yahweh said unto Moses, Hew thee out TWO TABLES OF STONE LIKE UNTO THE FIRST and bring them up into the
            mount and I will write upon these Tables the words that were in the First Tables which thou breakest. Moses
            did all that Yahweh-Elohim had commanded before he ascended Mount Sinai with the second tables of stone
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=34#v4">Exodus 34:4</a>). While Moses was in the Cloud covered
            Mount this time Yahweh-Elohim (in a VISION, which was
            repeated in part) returned Moses’ ATTENTION back to Adam and Eve in perfect Peace, within the Garden of
            Eden, wherein also was the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which they were forbidden to eat thereof.
            This is where Moses left them at the end of his SECOND TRIP (see chart on page 21). NOTE: Some Theologians
            think this second reference to Adam and Eve, beginning in the second chapter of Genesis establishes a second
            account of the Creation, BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE. It was here at this time that Moses saw the Serpent that
            DECEIVED and caused the Transgression of Eve and the Sin and instantaneous DEATH of Adam in his conscience
            in the Garden of Eden. Thereafter, in the cool of that

            AME DAY or as the Sun went down, Moses saw the Angel with the “Flaming Sword” drive Adam the earthly Son of
            Yahweh-Elohim out of the Garden and the Woman, Eve, voluntarily went out with him. Thereafter, Moses saw (in
            the Vision) the birth of all the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve, and the rest of the generations of
            mankind that followed, which included the Patriarchs, and the Historical Events that he recorded in the Book
            of Genesis and a part of that which is recorded in the Book of Exodus. In order to express the same thought
            in a better understandable way, let us say here that Yahweh-Elohim brought Moses up to date while he was in
            the Mount.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses at the end of his forty day period descended from the Mount this THIRD and LAST TIME with the Second
            Tables of Stone, with the Commandments of Yahweh-Elohim written thereon, which signified the New Covenant
            with Israel (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=34#v29">Exodus 34:29</a>). He then directed the
            construction and dedication of the TABERNACLE and the
            Priesthood and their operation therein. He remained alive and saw the Israelites multiply one hundred fold
            during the forty years they were in the Wilderness, while all the rest of the Israelites that were born in
            Egypt died except Caleb, Eleazar and Phinehas.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            During this forty years Moses wrote or caused to be written, the five Books of the Law, Torah or Pentateuch,
            often referred to as the Books of the OLD TESTAMENT. Moses LAST and FINAL ERROR was made when he SMOTE the
            rock at Horeb instead of SPEAKING to it as Yahweh-Elohim had told him to do, so that the Israelites could
            have water to drink and for other purposes (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=4&chapter=20#v8__3">Numbers
                20:8-11</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Yahweh-Elohim then told Moses to write “the Song of Victory,” place Joshua in command of Israel, which he
            did, and then he would be permitted to go up into Mount Nebo and view the Promised Land. He died there at
            the age of one hundred and twenty (120) years. Yahweh buried him there (Deuteronomy chapters 31 thru 34).
            Joshua and the Israelites mourned Moses death thirty days and Joshua gave them three more days to prepare
            victuals and then they crossed over the divided waters of the River Jordan and invaded the Land of Canaan.
            In a course of time when they had conquered their enemies and reached Mount Zion, Joshua, Caleb, Eleazar and
            Phinehas divided the Land of Canaan among the Israelites. They left eight tribes or nations remain therein.
            Joshua died a natural death at the age of one hundred and ten (110) years in the border of his inheritance
            in Timnathserah, in Mount Ephraim (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=6&chapter=24#v29__1">Joshua

                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=24">John 4:24</a>). That
            is to say, Yahweh is “The Ultimate Source, Infinite and Immaculate Substance, the Incomprehensible and

            the attributes of Intelligence, Wisdom, Knowledge, Love, Beauty, Justice, Foundation, Power and Strength. He

            that Yahweh, by the process of Transmutation, took on Super Incorporeal Form (in part, not in totality)
            before He began to create the Angelic Host. After the physical creation, Yahweh, in this Super Incorporeal

            Morning, because of his great Beauty and Wisdom, wherewith Elohim had created him, lifted himself up or
            rebelled against Yahweh. This caused a rebellion in Heaven among the Angels, and therefore, Lucifer and his
            host were found guilty before Elohim, and were cast out of Heaven into the Ethereal Darkness that surrounded
            the Earth after the beginning of the physical creation. This was the ORIGIN of Satan, the Evil Spirit

            THE SCIENTIFIC DISPUTATION OF THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT OF THE CREATION
        </h4>
        <p class="ti">
            The world’s greatest intellectually-minded and academically trained Theologians openly confess that they
            cannot reconcile the Biblical account of the Creation in Genesis, chapter one to chapter two, verse four
            with the many scientific accounts of the creation of Heaven and Earth. Although, there are many points of
            which they disagree, we will limit this discussion to he following:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (1) The Biblical scholars cannot satisfactorily explain how that there was LIGHT BEFORE THE SUN, MOON and
            STARS WERE CREATED and placed in the Heavens on the Fourth day.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) The Religious Scholars cannot explain how that the VEGETATION CAME FORTH FROM THE GROUND AND GREW INTO
            FRUITION ON THE THIRD DAY BEFORE THE SUN WAS PLACED IN THE HEAVENS ON THE FOURTH DAY OF CREATION.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (3) The Biblical account that vegetation was complete in all of its forms on the Third day of the Creation
            before any animal life appeared on the fifth and sixth day of Creation is not understood nor can be
            explained.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            These points of contention are mentioned in Funk and Wagnall New Standard Bible Dictionary Third Revised
            Edition, under the caption, “COSMOGONY”, <a href="#v1_152">page 152</a>; here, fifty-nine contributors of
            the world’s best known Biblical scholars plainly admit that they cannot reconcile the Biblical account of
            Creation with accepted scientific belief and concepts because of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (a) Science recognizes the SUN AS THE SOURCE OF LIGHT and it is necessary for the GROWTH AND PROPAGATION OF
            ALL PLANT LIFE.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (b) Science teaches that PLANT and ANIMAL LIFE EXISTS in a SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP, where one cannot thrive
            without the other.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            The utter failure on the part of these astute and worldly-trained Biblicists to dissolve their differences
            with the scientists is due mainly to the fact that they try to explain the Creation without recognizing and
            acknowledging the Creator who is the True SON of YAHWEH (ELOHIM). HOW CAN THERE BE A CREATION WITHOUT A
            CREATOR?
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            We have fully explained elsewhere in this book (see the chart of Moses’ Vision, page l8) that Moses received
            a Vision of the Creation while he was in the Cloud that covered the top of Mount Sinai for six days in the
            year 1490 B.Y. (before Yahshua the Messiah), after he had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v16">Exodus 24:16</a>). Moses was accompanied in Mount Sinai
            by JOSHUA the Son of Nun, who in fact was YAHSHUA
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=4&chapter=13#v8__8">Numbers 13:8-16</a>), who TRANSFIGURED before Moses
            (see <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=17#v1__8"></a>Matthew 17:1-9). Thus, it was this
            Anthropomorphic

            DEMONSTRATED to Moses in his VISION that He was the True Creator of the Heavens and Earth and all that in
            them is. This Vision of Moses took place in the Realm of Eternity and not in the Realm of TIME as typified
            by his entering into the midst of the Cloud denoting pure Spirit or the Eternity of Yahweh.

        <p class="ti">
            It was this same JOSHUA who was with Moses and Aaron and the children of Israel down in Egypt and He was the
            Phenomenal Light that lit up the Land of Goshen where the Israelites had light in their dwellings, whereas
            throughout the rest of the land of Egypt, there was the plague of stygian black darkness. Furthermore, this
            same JOSHUA was that Phenomenal Cloud that furnished light unto the Israelites during their three day march
            to and through the Red Sea, and at the same time was absolute pitch-black darkness, to the pursuing host of
            Pharaoh. This phenomenal cloud went from before Israel and stood between Israel and Pharaoh and his host,
            thus one can see the division between Light and Darkness during the three days of the Migration out of Egypt
            and to and through the Red Sea. This same situation must be repeated so that there is definite and positive
            proof of its occurrence, so then Moses in his vision atop Mount Sinai of the migration of the Physical
            Creation out of Pure Spirit, we must see the existence of cosmic light and the dividing of the light and
            darkness during the first three days of the Creation; but let us please keep in mind that the origin of this
            light is JOSHUA (or Yahshua) and please let us be reminded that this is not Cosmic Light but the Light of
            the SON OF YAHWEH. When Yahshua the Messiah (who was the Son of Yahweh) spoke to the Jews during the 31⁄2
            years of His ministry, He told them that He was the LIGHT of the world (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=9#v5">John 9:5</a>). In further confirmation
            of this fact, John in his Vision on the Isle of Patmos, who wrote of Yahshua the Messiah in the book of
            Revelation, “and the City (Jerusalem above) had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it: for
            the glory of Yahweh (Elohim) did lighten it, and the LAMB is the LIGHT thereof” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=21#v23">Revelation 21:23</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            These academically trained Theologians failed to differentiate between the SON of Yahweh and the SUN in the
            sky which is only a reflection or a type or shadow of the REAL SON (Elohim). Yet, there is a definite
            relationship between the two, as is clearly shown by Yahweh-Elohim’s waiting until the cool of the evening
            as the SUN in the sky was going down to cast Adam, the SON of Yahweh (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=42&chapter=3#v38">Luke 3:38</a>) out of the Garden of Eden
            into outer darkness after his SIN. Here we can see that the two, (the Sun in the sky and the Son of Yahweh)
            are going down together. Likewise, as Yahshua the Messiah was dying on the cross and all of the Life (or
            Light) was draining out of His physical body, the Sun in the sky began to darken and to go down into stygian
            black darkness from the sixth to the ninth hour. Here again, the Sun in the sky is coordinated with the SON
            of Yahweh as the two go on down together. Then, three days later, as it began to dawn toward the first day
            of the week, that is, as the Sun in the sky was coming up, the Son of Yahweh (Yahshua) rose from the grave
            thus accomplishing the rising of the two (Son and Sun) together.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Malachi confirms that these two Suns (Son and Sun), are one and the same, for he wrote, “But unto you that
            revere my Name, shall the SUN of righteousness arise with healing in His wings” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=39&chapter=4#v2">Malachi 4:2</a>). Here, the
            Prophet Malachi is plainly referring to Yahshua the Messiah, the SON OF YAHWEH, but he refers to Him as the
            SUN. Thus, it is plain to those who have the eyes to see, that ELOHIM the SON of YAHWEH was the beginning of
            the Creation of Yahweh (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=3#v14">Revelation 3:14</a>), and Creator
            of Heaven and Earth (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=1#v1__1">John 1:1-2</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=51&chapter=1#v13__4">Colossians 1:13-17</a>),
            and He was before all things, including the Sun which was placed in the Heaven on the Fourth day to be a
            witness of Yahshua the Messiah, the fleshly SON of Yahweh, who was placed in the earth plane in the 4000th
            year after the Adamic man was driven out of the Garden of Eden. (Remember that one day with Yahweh is as a
            thousand years, and a thousand years is as one day — <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=19&chapter=90#v4">Psalms 90:4</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=61&chapter=3#v8">II Peter 3:8</a>). This Elohim (or Joshua) who
            spoke to Moses at the Burning Bush told him that he should tell Pharaoh and the Israelites in Egypt that He
            was AYAH ASHER AYAH (which means I WILL BE WHAT I WILL TO BE). Thus He willed to be the SUN, MOON and STARS,
            and in fact, the UNIVERSE in its TOTALITY IS ONE OR ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF HIM (YAHWEH- ELOHIM). It is
            therefore no trouble for one to see how there was LIGHT before the SUN was placed in the Heavens on the
            Fourth day, for we see the SON of Yahweh (Elohim), who is the LIGHT OF THE WORLD.

            third day, before the SUN was placed in the Heavens on the fourth day is no problem when one sees that the
            seed of Abraham (the children of Israel) came up out of Egypt and were Baptized in the Cloud and the Sea the
            third day; but let us remember that Joshua (Moses’ minister) was right along with them and He was the one
            who delivered them out of Egypt (see Joshua 24th chapter). Therefore, that which caused the seed of
            vegetation to grow up without the aid of the ethereal Sun in the Heavens, is the same SON which caused the
            seed of Abraham to rise up out of Egypt and go on through the Wilderness into Canaan Land. Likewise, that
            which raised the Messiah from the dead on the third day was not the physical SUN in the sky, but ELOHIM, the
            Incorporeal or Anthropomorphic Form or SON of Yahweh (see <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=44&chapter=3#v13__2">Acts 3:13-15</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Truly, the vegetable kingdom coming forth on the third day, typifies the Angelic Creation whereas the animal
            kingdom coming forth later typifies the earthly or physical creation, and as angels are ministering spirits
            which are incarnated in all mankind and are inseparable from mankind, so must the vegetable and animal
            kingdoms be inseparably related. The plants exist on the carbon dioxide excreted by animals, and the animals
            exist on the oxygen liberated from the plants but both vegetable and animal life are dependent upon the SON
            (or SUN) which is the source of all life. The Apostle Paul wrote that Yahshua the Messiah who raised from
            the dead on the third day was the firstfruits of them that slept (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=46&chapter=15#v20">I Corinthians 15:20</a>), and after His
            resurrection, many of the saints (or Sons of Yahweh), who slept in the dust of the earth arose and went on
            into Jerusalem (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=27#v52__1">Matthew 27:52-53</a>).

            As we have already said heretofore, when one begins to read the book of Genesis he MUST realize that he is
            reading an account of the VISION that Moses had in the year 1490 B.Y. in the Cloud atop Mount Sinai.
            Yahweh-Elohim is showing Moses in a Vision how He had already created the Heavens and the Earth, for Moses
            was standing on physical Mount Sinai and furthermore, Moses himself is not conscious of any time whatsoever,
            as he is viewing a RERUN of the Creation of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Eternity. Moses’ account of the
            Creation with the Divine Pattern of the Tabernacle which he also received confirms that Yahweh-Elohim is the
            ARCHETYPAL OR ORIGINAL PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE and CONCLUSIVELY PROVES HIM to be AYAH ASHER AYAH, or I WILL
            BE WHAT I WILL TO BE. The whole Universal Creation witnesses to this, and this is the purpose for which it
            was created. Thus, we have shown WHEN, WHERE, HOW and WHY, Moses received the Vision of the Creation, and
            this is Scientifically and Scripturally proven by the Universe in all of its manifestations and the Holy
            Scriptures.

            It should be an eye-opener to all of the world seeing that all of these deep esoteric secrets of YAHWEH (who
            is a great mystery - <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=54&chapter=3#v16">I Timothy 3:16</a>), are being
            explained and revealed to all that will accept the Truth.
            This positively points to the fact that this Age is almost ready to come to a close, as the Apostle John
            wrote, “But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, THE MYSTERY OF
            YAHWEH should be finished, as He hath declared to His servants the Prophets” (<a

        <p class="ti">
            In the initial production of matter, it must FIRST appear in the Beginning of Moses’ vision as a parent mass
            of conglomeration or amalgamation of inorganic substance without particular descriptive shape or form or
            chaotic condition (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v2">Genesis 1:2</a>), as evidenced by the
            dark, chaotic, plague stricken land of Egypt in the
            beginning of the Migration (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=11#v1__5">Exodus 11:1-6</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Matter, in the second state, must take on descriptive shape and organic form to prove the invisible is
            understood by the visible (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=45&chapter=1#v19__1">Romans 1:19-20</a>), as
            evidenced by the building of the physical Tabernacle in the
            Wilderness (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=25">Exodus chapter 25</a> through 30), in harmony with
            the creation of the greater and more perfect
            Tabernacle, the Universe (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1">Genesis chapter 1</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Matter then must be animated as evidenced by the physical Tabernacle being filled with the Spirit (breath of
            life) as shown by the Cloud covering the Tabernacle (outside and inside) <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=40#v34__2">Exodus 40:34-36</a>, and further proven
            by Yahweh-Elohim breathing into the nostrils of both beast and man the Breath of Life (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=2#v7">Genesis 2:7</a>,<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=2#v19">19</a> also
            <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=7#v21__1">Genesis 7:21-22</a>), and confirmed after the
            resurrection of Yahshua the Messiah when He breathed on His
            disciples and said to them, “Receive Ye the Holy Spirit” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=20#v22">John 20:22</a>); which they did receive on the Day of
            Pentecost, as evidenced by the Mighty Rushing Wind, which filled them and the whole house whereby they were
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=44&chapter=2#v4">Acts 2:4</a>).

            Thus, this esoteric and exotic secret was revealed to Solomon and expressed in these words, “Yahweh
            possessed me in the BEGINNING of His way, BEFORE HIS WORKS OF OLD. I was set up from EVERLASTING, from the
            BEGINNING, or EVER THE EARTH WAS. When there WERE NO DEPTHS, I was brought forth; when there WERE NO
            FOUNTAINS ABOUNDING WITH WATER. Before the mountains were SETTLED, BEFORE THE HILLS WAS I BROUGHT FORTH:
            While as YET HE HAD NOT MADE THE EARTH, NOR THE FIELDS, NOR THE HIGHEST PART OF THE DUST OF THE WORLD. When
            He prepared the heavens, I WAS THERE: when He set a compass upon the face of the depth. When He established
            the clouds above. When He strengthened the fountains of the deep. When He gave to the sea His decree, that
            the waters should not pass His COMMANDMENT: WHEN HE APPOINTED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH: THEN I WAS BY
            HIM, AS ONE BROUGHT UP WITH HIM” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=20&chapter=8#v22__8">Proverbs
                8:22-30</a>). The above statement of Solomon agrees with the
            Revelation of John which reads as follows: “And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
            things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of Elohim (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=3#v14">Revelation
                3:14</a> and also see <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=1#v1__13">John 1:1-14</a>).

            Whereas Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the seventy elders, after ascending Mount Sinai, SAW (in a vision)
            Yahshua the Messiah this Super Incorporeal Form whom they recognized as the Elohim of Israel; (“And they saw
            the Elohim of Israel; and there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it
            were the Body of Heaven in His clearness” - <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v10">Exodus
                24:10</a>), BEFORE Moses entered into the midst of the Cloud,
            which typified his entrance into the presence of Elohim in “THE REALM OF ETERNITY”, wherein Moses HEARD the
            spoken words of Elohim, BEFORE TIME BEGAN, which SPONTANEOUSLY transformed Spirit or substance, in part,
            into a large super mass of inorganic and inanimate matter.

            “FOR HE SPAKE, AND IT WAS DONE; HE COMMANDED, AND IT STOOD FAST” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=19&chapter=33#v9">Psalms 33:9</a>). “Through faith we understand
            that the WORLDS WERE FRAMED BY THE WORD OF YAHWEH SO THAT THINGS WHICH ARE SEEN WERE NOT MADE OF THINGS
            WHICH DO APPEAR” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=58&chapter=11#v3">Hebrews 11:3</a>). With the Heaven
            (space) and Earth in this condition, Moses “SAW,”
            recognized and said, “In the beginning (of his vision) Elohim created the Heaven and Earth” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v1">Genesis 1:1</a>).
            If we, as scientists, engaged in an extensive and intensified research, thoroughly understood by Divine
            Interpretation that Yahweh is Spirit (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=4#v24">John 4:24</a>)
            inhabiting Eternity (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=23&chapter=57#v15">Isaiah 57:15</a>), and that
            Yahweh-Elohim
            created MATTER and that MATTER IS SPIRIT MATERIALIZED, which materialization took place SPONTANEOUSLY, in
            the Realm of Eternity, BEFORE TIME BEGAN and still continues to abide within this Eternal Realm, then we
            could very easily UNDERSTAND that there is no solution to the Age-old problem and question of “HOW OLD THE
            HEAVEN AND EARTH IS.” Actually, we must UNDERSTAND that we CANNOT TIME, or calculate the Age of Creation by
            the physical objects of the Creation, such as the operation of the Sun, Moon and Stars, when it is the
            repeated routine function of these previously created objects that make up what we call “TIME.” Or in other
            words, we cannot take the created objects which are necessary to establish TIME, to TIME their own creation.
            Therefore, scientists never will by Geological, Archeological and other methods of scientific research,
            including OUTER SPACE EXPLORATION, be able to determine the Age of the Creation, without FIRST determining
            the AGE of the ETERNAL CREATOR, Yahweh, because, as we have already explained, MATTER IS SPIRIT
            MATERIALIZED. For example, A watch is made to tell TIME, in seconds, minutes and hours, but it was not made
            to TELL HOW OLD THE WATCH itself is, <span class="u">or</span> <span class="u">the</span> <span

            multiply in the earth. <span class="u">23</span> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

        <p class="ti">
            <span class="u">24</span> And Elohim said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind,
            cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind: and Elohim saw that it
            was good. <span class="u">25</span> And Elohim made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after
            their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and Elohim saw that it was good.

            have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the
            earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. <span class="u">27</span> So Elohim
            created man in His own image, in the image of Elohim created he him; male and female created he him. <span

            And the SEVENTH DAY He (Elohim) called unto Moses out of the midst of the CLOUD. And the sight of the Glory
            of Yahweh was like a devouring fire on the top of the Mount in the EYES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. And Moses
            went into the MIDST of the CLOUD, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and
            forty nights (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v15__3">Exodus 24:15-18</a>).

            To summarize the (c) section under the caption of the EXPLANATION, we are referring to THE VISION AND

            Yahweh inhabits ETERNITY (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=23&chapter=57#v15">Isaiah 57:15</a>), as indicated
            by His Super Incorporeal Form, WITHIN THE CLOUD, that
            covered Mount Sinai. Hence, the actual CREATION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH must emanate from Yahweh and TAKE PLACE
            IN THE REALM OF ETERNITY. Therefore, these created physical objects such as the Sun, Moon, Stars and other
            Planets function within the REALM OF ETERNITY and cause the REALM OF TIME TO EXIST.

            Moses, having first seen Elohim (in the Vision) before He began to create, therefore, SAW the entire process
            of the CREATION. When he began to write, starting with the beginning of the VISION, he wrote: “In the
            beginning Elohim created the HEAVEN AND THE EARTH” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v1">Genesis
                1:1</a>).

        <p class="ti">
            This Panoramic Vision of Elohim in the process of creation which Moses SAW while he was “WITHIN THE CLOUD,”
            symbolizes his presence within “THE DAY” or within “ETERNITY” during the first SIX SOLAR DAYS of the forty
            day period that he was in Mount Sinai. This was in the third (Sacred) month, Sivan (comparable to our June),
            and year of 2513 A.M. or 1490 B.Y., and was recorded AS IS, in the first part of the BOOK OF GENESIS. As
            Moses was a witness, through the Vision of the creation we can understand HOW he could WRITE THE HISTORY OF
            THE CREATION OF THE HEAVEN AND EARTH and compile the BOOK OF GENESIS.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Regarding the “SABBATH DAY” as a day of rest for mankind to keep, it is easy to see and clearly
            understandable that, since Moses WROTE the Book of Genesis in the Wilderness of Sinai in l490 B.Y. and
            placed the VISION, which he SAW in the Mount, in the first part of the Book of Genesis, AS IS; neither Adam
            nor any other of the Ante-diluvian or Post-diluvian Patriarchs prior to Moses could have known anything
            about the SABBATH DAY. In the second month (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=16#v1">Exodus
                16:1</a>) after their arrival and residence in the Wilderness
            of Sinai, the Israelites began to murmur for food and for six days Elohim gave them manna from Heaven
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=16#v23__5">Exodus 16:23-28</a>). They were to gather enough on
            the sixth day to supply them during the SEVENTH DAY or THE
            SABBATH. It was here in the Wilderness of Sinai at this time, 1490 B.Y., that for the first time in the
            History of the World Elohim FIRST mentioned to mankind anything about the REST or the SEVENTH DAY, or the
            keeping of A SABBATH DAY. Elohim in speaking the Commandments from Mount Sinai, in the third month (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=19#v1">Exodus
                19:1</a>) THEREAFTER, reminded the Israelites to remember the SABBATH DAY to keep it HOLY. After
            speaking the
            Commandments from Mount Sinai, Elohim called Moses up into the Mount which the CLOUD covered SIX SOLAR DAYS,
            and Moses SAW Elohim in the process of CREATING THE HEAVEN AND EARTH (<a
                href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-1/" target="_blank">Genesis 1:1-31</a> and <a
                href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-1/" target="_blank">Genesis 2:1-4,
                K.J.V.</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It was here in Mount Sinai that Yahweh (who, as already explained is Spirit) took on the Super Incorporeal
            Form of a man (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v10">Exodus 24:10</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=26&chapter=1#v26">Ezekiel 1:26</a>) and appeared to Moses in “A VISION”.
            Thereafter, the transmutable part of Spirit (or the three-fold “Godhead”) was spontaneously transformed into
            the APPARENT ethereal
            Darkness and Chaotic physical SUBSTANCE which Moses SAW and recognized to be the “Heaven and Earth” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v1">Genesis
                1:1</a>). Paradoxical as it may seem, John, in his Vision on the Isle of Patmos stated that the “Lamb of
            Yahweh”
            was slain “From the Foundation of the World” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=13#v8">Revelation
                13:8</a>; <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=17#v8">Revelation 17:8</a>), which means that the
            “Paschal Lamb” in the Dark Chaotic Land of Egypt had to be slain therein “From the Beginning of the
            migration or departure of the Israelites from Egypt.” Thus, the Heaven and Earth which Moses SAW in the
            VISION WITHIN THE MIDST of

            the CLOUD was in the same Dark Chaotic condition as the Land of Egypt AFTER the pouring out of the “Ten
            Plagues” and the offering and Blood of the “Paschal Lamb” BEFORE the BEGINNING of the Israelites departure
            therefrom (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=12#v1__14">Exodus 12:1-15</a>).

            In this “COMPARATIVE TYPE” we are using the Red Sea for a boundary line between Egypt and the Wilderness of
            Sinai. In other words, we are using the Mystic Darkness and waters of the Red Sea to completely surround the
            Plague stricken Chaotic Land of Egypt, as described in the beginning of Moses’ VISION OF THE CREATION in <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v1__30">Genesis 1:1-31</a>. (See and compare <a

                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=10#v21__2">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). From within this ethereal
            Darkness and Chaotic MASS Moses HEARD Elohim speak the words, “Let there be light: and there WAS LIGHT” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v3">Genesis 1:3</a>).

            After the dawn of Cosmic Light and from within this great CHAOTIC MASS Moses “SAW” Elohim (the Heavenly

            vegetable and animal kingdoms as Moses knew them before, and as we now know them.

        <p class="ti">
            In this VISION Elohim, in “Speaking and Dealing” with this PARENT MASS, during these SIX (SOLAR) DAYS,
            thoroughly demonstrated that He is “UNIVERSAL SPIRIT LAW and ORDER WITHIN HIMSELF.” Whereas, on the SEVENTH
            DAY He rested and Sanctified that DAY because in it He RESTED FROM HIS WORK OF CREATION (<a
                href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-2/" target="_blank">Genesis 2:1-,
                K.J.V.3</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Before Moses descended the Mount after he had witnessed the CREATION OF HEAVEN and EARTH during the first
            SIX SOLAR DAYS and Elohim had rested the Seventh Day, Elohim called unto Moses out of the CLOUD and gave him
            the FIRST tables of stone (already written with the finger of Elohim before Moses went up into the Mount),
            with the Law of Commandments engraved therein. Elohim had instructed Moses to place the tables of stone with
            the Commandments written therein inside the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place in the Tabernacle.
            Moses, in descending the Mount, came within view of the Children of Israel disobeying the Commandments of
            Elohim by worshipping the Golden Calf. In seeing the children of Israel worshipping the Golden Calf, Moses
            waxed hot and threw down the first tables of stone and broke them. Note: Moses DID NOT SEE THE ADAMIC
            TRANSGRESSION until his THIRD TRIP up into the Mount. After Elohim and Moses had chastised the Children of
            Israel for making and worshipping the Golden Calf, Elohim called unto Moses and told him to hew himself out
            two tables of stone and come back up into the Mount again, and He would write the SAME WORDS on the second
            tables of stone (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=34#v1__1">Exodus 34:1-2</a>), which he was to
            place in the Ark of the Covenant, signifying the New
            Covenant (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=24&chapter=31#v31__3">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). If we subtract the
            SEVEN DAYS which includes the SABBATH from the forty days
            and nights which Moses remained in the Mount, we will have THIRTY-THREE more days that Moses remained in the
            Mount after he SAW the VISION OF CREATION, which (counting one day for a year, <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=4&chapter=14#v34">Numbers 14:34</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=26&chapter=4#v6">Ezekiel 4:6</a>)
            is equivalent to the WORD OF YAHWEH, manifested in the FLESH, or the total (331/2 years) life span of
            Yahshua The Messiah, on the earth plane fulfilling the Law and the Prophesies (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=23&chapter=8#v20">Isaiah 8:20</a>; <a

            JOSHUA (MOSES’ MINISTER) AND YAHSHUA (THE MESSIAH), WERE YAHWEH ELOHIM MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            It is necessary at this point to do a little back tracking, so that we might bring out a most interesting
            and revealing phenomenon. When Moses had his vision at the Burning Bush and Yahweh-Elohim commissioned him
            to go back down into Egypt to liberate his people from the bondage of Pharaoh, He (Yahweh-Elohim) told
            Moses, CERTAINLY I WILL BE WITH THEE in Egypt (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=3#v12">Exodus
                3:12</a>). Yahweh- Elohim further demonstrated His power to be what He willed to be when He had Moses to
            cast down his Rod to the ground and it turned to a serpent, and when he picked it up by the tail, it turned
            back into a rod again. He also gave him two other signs that we will not deal with at this time, as we want
            to proceed with our main thought.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            When Moses and Aaron came into Egypt, YAHWEH-ELOHIM WAS THERE WITH THEM AS HE SAID, but one would not
            appreciate this fact without a revelation by the Holy Spirit. There was One in Egypt with Moses and Aaron by
            the name of Oshea whom Moses called Joshua (correctly rendered, this is Yahshua; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=4&chapter=13#v8">Numbers 13:8</a>,<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=4&chapter=13#v16">16, H.N.B.</a>),
            but there is no direct reference to this at that time. The first account of this Yahshua, after they came
            out of Egypt, is given in the <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=17">17th chapter of Exodus</a> where
            He fights with the Amalekites and prevails as
            long as Aaron and Hur held up the arms of Moses, who was sitting on a Rock. Moses, in his record of
            genealogies, lists Joshua as the Son of Nun, of the Tribe of Ephraim who was the second son of Joseph, and
            right away some carnal minded person would think that Joshua was old man Nun’s son, but this is not true.
            THIS JOSHUA was of NONE (Nun) of the Twelve Sons of Jacob or the Twelve Tribes of Israel. He was Elohim who
            had taken on a fleshly manifestation, having not been born of any pre-existing fleshly parents, but
            Materialized out of the Incorporeal Spirit Form. Remember Yahweh-Elohim has the power to BE WHAT HE WILLS TO
            BE. Joseph had prophesied to his brethren that Elohim would surely visit them and bring them out of Egypt
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=50#v24__1">Genesis 50:24-25</a>). Thus He was with Moses and
            Aaron in Egypt as He had promised to be, but His true identity was hid from the Israelites.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            The Apostle Paul confirms that this Joshua (who was Yahshua) was the one who led the Israelites out of Egypt
            for he says, “Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were
            under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all immersed unto Moses in the cloud and in the
            sea; and did all eat the same spiritual food; and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of
            that Spiritual Rock that went with them: and that Rock was (Yahshua) the Messiah” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=46&chapter=10#v1__3">1 Corinthians 10:1-4, H.N.B.</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            One might still question in his mind as to the veracity of Joshua being without any fleshly parents, not
            realizing that he is over-throwing another scriptural tenet that he is asked to believe, and that is, Adam’s
            being created or born of Virgin Mother Earth without any pre-existing physical parents, and farther on down
            the line, Yahshua the Messiah’s virgin birth. If one cannot accept Joshua’s coming forth without physical
            parents, how can he accept Adam’s and Yahshua the Messiah’s situations? One would ask then, why does Moses
            list him as an offspring of Ephraim who came out of Joseph, or why is he attached to Ephraim? Moses attaches
            Joshua to Ephraim (although Moses knew better but it could not be revealed at that time) for the same reason
            that Yahshua the Messiah appeared to be attached to Joseph. However, Luke the physician, with the Holy
            Spirit in him after Pentecost, explains that Yahshua the Messiah born of the virgin Mary, was NOT of Joseph
            as he writes thusly, “And Yahshua Himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the
            son of Joseph” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=42&chapter=3#v23">Luke 3:23</a>). Thus, Yahshua the Messiah
            appeared to be the son of Joseph, in the same way that
            Joshua (Yahshua) the Son of Nun, appeared to be of the lineage of Ephraim out of Joseph, for the purpose of
            Yahweh carrying out His will and His way. The Prophets had said that they (the Israelites) would not KNOW
            the time of their visitation (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=24&chapter=8#v12">Jeremiah 8:12</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=23&chapter=10#v3">Isaiah 10:3</a>, <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=28&chapter=9#v7">Hosea 9:7</a>), that is, that they would not know and
            recognize that Yahshua the Messiah was the Son of Yahweh (and not Joseph) so that they would deny Him and
            crucify Him as was fore ordained.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Yahshua the Messiah told the Jews plainly that He was back there with Abraham and the Patriarchs and
            Prophets when He said to them, “Your father Abraham prayed to see my day; and

            he saw it, and was glad. Then said the Jews unto him, thou are not yet fifty years old, and has thou seen
            Abraham? Yahshua said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=8#v56__2">John 8:56-58</a>).

            So it is that Joshua (who is Yahshua), who was down in Egypt but he was not known, just as Yahshua the
            Messiah was not known when He was in the earth plane. Later, when Moses is called up into Mount Sinai the
            SECOND TIME ALONE and by himself, it is this same Joshua who was Moses’ minister who went up into the Mount
            with Moses (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v1__1">Exodus 24:1-2</a>, <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v13">13</a>) and he transfigured before Moses into the
            Incorporeal Form again (as he was
            at the Burning Bush), and Moses sees him in a Vision create the heavens and the earth. This Incorporeal Form
            was Elohim (Yahshua) the Archetype (original) Pattern of the Universe, “the faithful and true witness the
            beginning of the creation of Yahweh” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=3#v14">Revelation
                3:14</a>). Moses further sees Him create the man, Adam, and form the woman, Eve, from his body in the
            Garden of Eden (Moses also saw the book that Yahweh-Elohim wrote of all the genealogies of mankind); and He
            further shows Moses, and tells him about the Tabernacle that He desires him to build in the Wilderness of
            Sinai.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses had previously told Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the seventy elders to tarry at the place where they had
            seen the vision of the Incorporeal Form of Elohim until he and Joshua returned, but they DISOBEYED, and
            returned back down the Mount to the camp of the Israelites and made the Golden Calf. If they had obeyed
            Moses, they would not have gotten into the trouble of making the Golden Calf, which displeased Moses so very
            much that he broke the Tablets of the Covenant. Nevertheless, this was according to Yahweh’s Will, for He
            had told Moses to place the Tables of the Covenant in the Ark of the Covenant, but there was no Ark of the
            Covenant as Moses had not had time to tell the Israelites how to build it. There is another correlative
            instance of such disobedience on the part of Yahshua the Messiah’s disciples as He told them, after He had
            resurrected from the grave and had tarried on earth for forty days, to tarry at Jerusalem and wait for the
            Promise of the Father (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=44&chapter=1#v4">Acts 1:4</a>). These disciples,
            however, having learned from the Messiah that the Law and
            Prophets has to be fulfilled (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=42&chapter=24#v44__1">Luke 24:44-45</a>), they
            found the passage of scripture in <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=19&chapter=109#v8">Psalms 109:8</a>, where
            it
            speaks of Judas’ fall and that another would take his bishopric. Since, therefore, Yahshua the Messiah had
            not told them who would take Judas’ place, they took it upon themselves to fill his place by casting lots
            and the lot fell on Matthias who was numbered with them (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=44&chapter=1#v20">Acts 1:20</a>). This, however, was in direct disobedience
            to what the Messiah told them to do; He did not tell them to pick or choose another Apostle. Furthermore,
            this was against the Purpose and Plan of Yahweh, for the Apostle Paul was the one whom the Holy Spirit had
            chosen before the foundation of the world to take Judas’ place.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            At the end of Moses’ forty days in the Mount, he descends the Mount and it is Joshua who tells him of the
            noise in the camp of Israel, and tells Moses to hurry down from the Mount; and when Moses sees that Israel
            (with Aaron) had made the Golden Calf in willful disobedience to Yahweh’s commandment which He had spoken to
            them from the Mount, he became very angry and threw down the two tablets of the covenant and broke them.
            Moses then fell down before Joshua who was his minister (just as Yahshua the Messiah said that He came not
            to be ministered unto, but to minister - <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=41&chapter=10#v45">Mark 10:45</a>),
            and pleaded with Joshua to forgive Israel for their
            great sin which they had committed in making the Golden Calf. Moses further said to Joshua “If thou wilt
            forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee out of thy book which thou has written” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=32#v32__1">Exodus 32:32-33</a>). Moses was referring to
            Yahweh-Elohim whom he had seen and understood in the Mount to be the Source and Substance of all human
            flesh, that is, all of the genetic material that would ever be materialized into human flesh was contained
            in Him, and He foreknew every living human creature by name
            before he would be formed in the womb. Remember that He (Yahweh-Elohim) had called Moses by his name at the
            Burning Bush, and Moses had seen his own name written in That Book.

        <p class="ti">
            John the Revelator made reference to this same book as follows: “And I saw the dead, small and great, stand
            before Elohim; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life” (see <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=66&chapter=20#v12__3">Rev.

            read of all men: forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Yahshua the Messiah ministered
            by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the Living Elohim; not in tables of stone, but in the
            fleshly tables of the heart” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=47&chapter=3#v2__1">II Corinthians 3:2-3</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Joshua (Yahshua) was a young man (remember that Yahshua the Messiah was only 33 years old when He was
            crucified) who dwelt always in the Tent or the Tabernacle of the congregation which Moses pitched without
            the camp of the Israelites. Whenever Moses wanted to inquire about some matter that he lacked knowledge of
            its solution, he went into this Tabernacle or Tent and received the answer from Joshua (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=33#v7__4">Exodus 33:7-11</a>,
            Joshua is referred to as the ‘Lord’ in the King James Version).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Because Moses had waxed hot and had thrown down and broken the First Tables of the Covenant written with the
            finger of Elohim when he saw that Israel had sinned in making the Golden Calf, he was told by Joshua to hew
            out his own tables of stone and come up the THIRD time in Mount Sinai. He further told Moses that he would
            write on these tables just as he had written on the first tables of stone. However, when Moses went into the
            Mount the THIRD time, Joshua DID NOT GO WITH HIM as he had done the first time (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v13">Exodus 24:13</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=33#v11">Exodus 33:11</a>)
            but he remained in his tent. Moses, therefore entered into the cloud as he had done the SECOND TIME but did
            not see the face of Elohim, but did see his back parts as he passed by, and as he wrote on the new tables of
            stone (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=33#v20__3">Exodus 33:20-23</a>). Although Joshua remained
            within his tent when Moses went in the Mount the THIRD TIME, He (Joshua) nevertheless, showed his back parts
            to Moses and communicated with Moses, thereby
            demonstrating his power of astral projection and telepathic communication. It was at this time when Moses
            went into the Mount the THIRD TIME that he saw the serpent in the Garden of Eden and the subsequent
            disobedience of Adam and Eve and Adam’s expulsion from the Garden. Had Moses seen the transgression of Adam
            and Eve when he was in the Mount the SECOND TIME, he would not have waxed hot and broken the first tables of
            stone when he saw that Aaron and Israel had transgressed the Commandments of Yahweh in building the Golden
            Calf. Moses would have known that Israel would have had no other recource than to repeat in type the sin of
            his earthly fore-parents in the Garden of Eden.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It was also during the THIRD trip into the Mount that Moses saw a repetition of the events that had
            previously transpired in his vision at the Burning Bush in the land of Midian. Elohim had told Moses at the
            Burning Bush to tell Pharaoh that Ayah Asher Ayah (which means: I will be what I will to be) had sent him to
            Egypt to liberate the Israelites from bondage; furthermore, Elohim had demonstrated His power to be what He
            willed to be, by having Moses cast his rod to the ground and it turned into a serpent and Moses fled from
            it. When Moses sees therefore the Serpent in the Garden, the Tree (same as the bush) of Knowledge of Good
            and Evil and Adam and Eve, he is seeing a repeat of the same circumstances. He also hears Yahweh-Elohim tell
            the woman, Eve, “and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed (the
            woman’s seed, which is Yahshua); he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=3#v15">Genesis 3:15</a>).
            This pronouncement is a prophetic utterance of Yahweh-Elohim setting forth the means by which Yahshua the
            Messiah was to come the next time (Remember we have already shown that Joshua, who is Yahshua, did not come
            into the flesh by woman or a man down in Egypt. The Apostle Paul spoke of Yahshua the Messiah’s coming by
            the woman thusly, “For as the woman (Eve) is of the man (Adam), even so is the man (Yahshua the Messiah)
            also by the woman” (Miriam or Mary, <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=46&chapter=11#v12">I Corinthians
                11:12</a>). NOTE: Let us here admonish the reader to hold this
            thought in mind until we finish the relating of Moses’ THIRD TRIP into the Mount, and then we will deal with
            this thought further in relation to Joshua or Yahshua).

        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses also sees in his vision during his third trip into the Mount, the genealogies of the flesh that
            proceeded out of Adam and Eve, and he heard and saw Yahweh-Elohim speak to the Patriarchs (although they did
            not know Him by that name — only as El Shaddi, meaning the Almighty Provider — <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=6#v3">Exodus 6:3, H.N.B.</a>). Moses
            heard and saw all of the events and happenings of the Ante-diluvian and Post-diluvian Ages unto the coming
            of Yahshua the Messiah and Pentecost, or in other words, HE saw the whole Purpose of Yahweh from start to
            finish, so that he might be one of the witnesses along with John the Revelator. Moses and John confirming
            one another, would therefore be as the Two Archangels which overshadowed the Mercy Seat with their faces

            toward the cloud where Yahweh said He would dwell, and it would not take a college graduate to see that the
            author of this work would have had to have a vision that encompassed both Moses’ and John’s in order to
            explain the things contained herein.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            When Moses descended the Mount the THIRD TIME with the Tablets of the Covenant in his hands, having seen
            Adam and Eve transgress in the Garden of Eden, he was much more tranquilized in his mind, because he now
            understood why Aaron and Israel had previously sinned in building the Golden Calf. He, therefore, placed
            these tablets in the Ark of the Covenant which the Israelites had constructed by this time (this Ark
            represents the head which always develops first in the womb), whereas the complete Tabernacle was ready
            until the following year. Also when Moses came down out of the Mount the THIRD TIME, his face shone and the
            children of Israel were afraid to come near him, therefore he put a vail over his face when he talked with
            them, but when he went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation where Joshua dwelled, he took the vail off
            (Exodus 34th chapter). The Apostle Paul states that this vail (the flesh) still remaineth to them who follow
            after the things contained under the Mosaic Dispensation, not seeing that Messiah fulfilled all of the
            carnal and fleshly ordinances.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses continued on with Joshua and the Israelites in their migration through the Wilderness of Sinai for a
            period of 40 years, and he died and the Israelites mourned his death 30 days and Joshua gave them 3 more
            days to make preparations, before the Israelites crossed over the River Jordan into Canaan Land. He was
            buried in the valley over against Beth-Peor in the Mount, and although the Bible clearly states that NO MAN
            knew the place of his burial, Joshua knew, for it was this same Yahshua (the Messiah) who produced Moses and
            showed him to Peter, James and John in their vision in Mount Transfiguration (Matthew 17th chapter). The
            Devil however, did not know where Moses was buried, and as Jude states it, he (the devil) disputed with
            Michael, the Archangel about where the body of Moses was buried, and Michael just said to the Devil, “Yahweh
            rebuke thee” (Jude 9th verse).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            After Moses’ death, Joshua led the Israelites across the Jordan into Canaan Land and he fought and subdued
            31 kingdoms in Canaan Land (also he had already subdued 2 kingdoms on this side of Jordan — 33 in all).
            Thus, we have shown that Joshua (who was Yahshua) was with the Israelites throughout their whole journey
            from Egypt to Canaan Land, but only Moses knew who he was. He was down in Egypt but as the Bible states,
            Israel saw no similitude of him (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=5&chapter=4#v12">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>);
            likewise in the Wilderness of Sinai, Joshua stayed in
            his tent and went not out of it, and only Moses went in to talk to him, face to face (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=33#v11">Exodus 33:11</a>).
            However, just before his (Joshua’s) death in Canaan Land, he assembled all of the elders and heads of the
            Tribes of Israel with the people unto Shechem and he openly and plainly told them that he was the one who
            had sent Moses and Aaron into Egypt, and that he was the one who delivered them out of bondage, and that he
            was the one who fought their battles all along the way, etc. (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=6&chapter=24">Joshua 24th chapter</a>). One would not discern by
            reading this <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=6&chapter=24">24th chapter of Joshua</a> that Joshua was
            talking of himself, although he uses the pronoun I
            throughout, but due to the fact that the Bible uses the term Lord in reference to Joshua, the real
            understanding is hidden. This Joshua was the Lord or the Lord God who had lead Israel all of the way from
            Egypt to Canaan Land; in other words, he was with them all of the way (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=40&chapter=28#v20">Matthew 28:20</a>). However, throughout all of these
            battles, Joshua was never killed, but he died at the ripe old age of 110 and was buried in the border of his
            inheritance in Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=6&chapter=24#v29__1">Joshua
                24:29-30</a>).

        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Now, the big $64,000 question is this: if we contend that this Joshua the Son of Nun was Yahshua who was
            with Moses throughout his journeying and he died at the age of 110 and was buried in Canaan Land, how did he
            get out of his grave and appear many hundreds of years later as Yahshua the Messiah?
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            We have already related how that Messiah said that He was before Abraham, and Abraham rejoiced to see His
            day (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=8#v56__2">John 8:56-58</a>), and He further said this,
            “Therefore, doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it
            from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay
            it down, and I have power to take it again” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=10#v17__1">John

            He was plainly telling the Jews of His day that He was the same Joshua who laid His life down in Canaan Land
            and was buried at the age of 110 years, but that He had the power to get up out of that grave, and appear
            again. This is what He meant when He spoke to Mary and Martha and said, “I am the Resurrection and the Life”
            (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=11#v25">John 11:25</a>). If He had remained in that earthly
            grave in Canaan Land, He certainly could not have been the
            Resurrection and the Life. Now concerning His being born of the Virgin Mary, remember that He had said to
            Adam and Eve that He would be the seed of the woman and that He would bruise the Serpent’s head. Joshua was
            buried in Timnath-serah; (do you see the similarity of SERAH to SARAH) and it was Sarah who was the mother
            of Isaac, the only son born to Abraham by the Promise of the Father Yahweh, and this Isaac was a type of the
            True Seed who was Yahshua the Messiah. Therefore, this True Seed had to come forth out of the loins of a
            woman which was Miriam (or Mary); as He came forth out of the loins of Miriam, whose body was as the dust of
            the earth, this was His Resurrection from that grave in Canaan Land to fulfill His words to Adam and Eve.
            However, we would not have you be ignorant of the fact that Joshua as an Incorporeal Spirit was never put in
            the ground in Canaan Land in the first place, and that this Holy Spirit was continuously with those that
            outlived Joshua even on down to this present time. Thus, it is possible for each one of us to see this
            Resurrected Elohim or Holy Spirit within the gray and white matter of our brain in a vision, and to know
            that He lives forevermore, never to die again.

            THE THEORY OF THE PRE-ADAMIC EARTH
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            Thus far, science has failed to present sufficient concrete evidence to prove the origin (the systematical
            development by a definite Yahweh-given Pattern), Purpose and final destiny of the Universe. Neither have the
            theological exponents of the Sacred Scriptures been able to do so with any dependable degree or scientifical
            accuracy or intellectual infallibility. For example: Some of our theological commentators on the Sacred
            Scriptures express the belief that there was a Pre-Adamic earth created and inhabited by a human race of
            people and destroyed before the creation of Adam.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            The subject is introduced in explanatory theological writings under the caption ORIGINAL OR PRE- ADAMIC
            EARTH. This theological idea was conceived and based on <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v1">Genesis 1:1</a> which reads as follows: “In the beginning
            Elohim created the heaven and the earth.” The foregoing quotation is offered and is supposed by the
            proponents of the doctrinal idea to be the Original or Pre-Adamic Earth with the previously created human
            inhabitants therein. For some reason, presumably sin, the exponents of this theological idea aim to show
            that Elohim overthrew the Original or Pre-Adamic Earth by using the second verse in Genesis to prove their
            point which reads as follows: “And the Earth was without form and void; and Darkness was upon the face
            of the deep. And the SPIRIT of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v2">Genesis 1:2</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            If we are to abide by the rules of correct implementation of language and punctuation, we are definitely
            compelled to disagree with the idea of supplemental disposition of unwritten words between the first and
            second verses of Genesis to modify the correct reading to prove non-scriptural, unsupported theological
            theory. To us the correct way to read and understand the first and second verses of the first chapter of
            Genesis are as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Notice that the first verse and first sentence (“In the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.”)
            ends with a period; the second verse and second sentence begins with the word “AND” which is an articulation
            or conjunction that joins together the first and second verses of <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v1__1">Genesis 1:1-2</a> to complete this thought. Hence, the
            second verse is Moses’ actual description of the CONDITION which the atmospherical heaven (not heavens) and
            physical earth was in when they were spontaneously created in the REALM OF ETERNITY. That is to say, the
            atmospherical heaven had no cosmic light, neither did it have illuminous physical objects such as
            the Sun, Moon and Stars. Likewise, the physical earth first appeared in its inorganic and inanimate state as
            Moses also indicates in his Vision as stated in the second verse, <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v2">Genesis 1:2</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            As heretofore stated, Moses, while within the CLOUD atop Mount Sinai, during his first trip up into the
            mountain, SAW Elohim (in a vision) creating the Heaven and the Earth, day by day in logical sequence during
            the first SIX SOLAR DAYS of this Vision. Whereupon, the creation having been finished, Elohim RESTED the
            SEVENTH DAY or the SABBATH, from His work of Creation and therefore, John states that he was on the Isle of
            Patmos on the SABBATH DAY or the SEVENTH DAY which is the same day that Moses states that Elohim RESTED from
            His work of creation. Moses having seen Elohim, the BEGINNING of Creation and John having seen the Messiah

            was looking from BEGINNING TO ENDING and John was looking from ENDING TO BEGINNING to complete, or to
            confirm the fulfillment of all things which were written in the Law and the Prophecies (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=42&chapter=24#v44">Luke 24:44</a>), which were done by THE ELOHIM or
            YAHSHUA THE MESSIAH to manifest His entire PURPOSE and PLAN through the Dispensations and Ages or from the

            That is to say, it was “HID” in Yahweh and NOT REVEALED
            unto them in its utter simplicity (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=60&chapter=1#v1__11">1 Peter 1:1-12</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            According to Biblical chronology, the Flood or Deluge, took place in the year of 1656 A.M. after the
            finished Creation, or 2348 B.Y. The vocation of the Patriarch Abraham begins 427 years after the Flood.
            Yahshua the Messiah said to the Jews, “Before Abraham was, I AM” (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=8#v58">John 8:58</a>). In confirmation of the above
            statement of The Messiah, the Apostles John and Paul stated that Yahshua The Messiah (of whom Moses and the
            Prophets wrote, <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=42&chapter=24#v44">Luke 24:44</a>), was Yahweh-Elohim
            Himself manifested in the FLESH (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=1#v1__3">John 1:1-4</a>,<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=1#v14">14</a>; <a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=54&chapter=3#v16">I Timothy
                3:16</a>). Therefore, before the beginning Creation and many centuries before the DAYS OF HIS FLESH (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=24#v10__1">Exodus
                24:10-11</a>), He was the ULTIMATE and ORIGINAL SOURCE from which all esoteric “secrets and profound
            mysteries”
            had their beginning.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            As such, He, Yahweh-Elohim is the SOURCE SUBSTANCE and the CREATOR of all so-called inanimate objects or
            things and living creatures, visible and invisible. Whereas, in the DAYS OF HIS FLESH, He knew and
            understood all things. According to the BIOGRAPHY of His life, in the days of His flesh (Matthew, Mark, Luke
            and John) He proved this inescapable TRUTH by the infinite WISDOM wherewith He taught the people and by the
            many MIRACLES which Yahweh performed through Him (Yahshua).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            As for Yahshua’s teaching, in the days of His flesh, it went a million miles over the heads of the Sanhedrin
            Council (teachers of Israel) and the multitudes. Today, nearly two thousand years hence, it is still as far
            over the heads of so-called Christendom. If this was not true, the world of mankind would have become
            reconciled unto Yahweh and among themselves in the beginning of the Christian era and remained so unto this
            day. As for His miracles which Yahweh performed through Him, He turned water into wine, told men their
            unexpressed thoughts, healed the sick, raised the dead, walked on the water, fed the multitudes, caused the
            fig tree to wither and stilled the tempest. Later on you will learn that Yahshua The Messiah performed these
            miracles by “UNIVERSAL SPIRIT LAW” and according to the Divine Pattern of the Universe.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Yahshua The Messiah fulfilled the Law and the Prophets (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=42&chapter=24#v44">Luke 24:44</a>) and told His disciples that they would
            receive the Holy Spirit from Elohim (after His departure out of the flesh) which would REVEAL the “secrets”
            of the Most High El unto them and impart KNOWLEDGE and UNDERSTANDING of the MYSTERY of His WAY and WILL.
            After the ascension of The Messiah, Elohim did REVEAL the great “secrets of secrets and mystery of
            mysteries” to the chosen Disciples of The Messiah. Thereafter, they knew by the Divine Pattern and the Law
            of Commandments in the Ark the Covenant, that there was in existence an ARCHETYPE PATTERN of the Universe
            with a “SPIRIT LAW” embodied therein. They understood the silent but POWERFUL, perpetual, routine FUNCTION
            and OPERATIONS of the UNIVERSAL SPIRIT LAW in relative coordination with the ARCHETYPE PATTERN. Since then,
            however, few others, if any, have ever received a full profound KNOWLEDGE of the EXISTENCE of the ARCHETYPE
            PATTERN and thoroughly understood the perpetual, routine operation of the SPIRIT LAW by which the Universe

            To speak directly of the masses of people on the earth plane, it would be absurd to say here that mankind,
            from his very earliest inception in the past Ages, did not BELIEVE in the existence of the SUPREME BEING of

            the creation and activities of man even in his primitive and also most advanced state give rise to the
            conviction as well as the final conclusion that MAN actually was CREATED with sufficient intellectual
            capacities. He was imbued with the “INTELLIGENCE and POWER” to reason, a disposition to fear and serve, and
            an instinct to BELIEVE in the eternal existence of a SUPREME BEING, who was and remains far more superior in
            POWER and INTELLIGENCE than man, himself. In fact, the Apostle Paul agreed with one of the Grecian poets (or
            philosophers) that we are the offspring of Elohim (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=44&chapter=17#v28">Acts
                17:28</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) Likewise, many Profane Historians and Philosophers including the Ancient, Medieval and Modern, from
            Herodotus to H.G. Wells and from Confucius to those of today, speaking of the CREATED state of primitive man
            in reference to his BELIEF in the eternal existence of a SUPREME BEING, lead directly to the same
            convictions and final conclusions as those of the sacred writers.

        <p class="ti">
            (3) To add to the abundance of testimony already given, the American and British Archaeological
            Expeditionary Forces, searching here and there or wherever pre-historic beast or man are thought to have
            existed, have unearthed plenty of incontestable evidence that since man’s inception, in every Age, he has
            exercised FAITH in the existence of a SUPREME BEING.

        <p class="ti">
            The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in l947 and the information stipulated in them further lends
            creditability and support to our argument that man always did believe in the existence of A SUPREME BEING.
            So, we understand, according to the records, it is NOT, the idea that mankind DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE
            EXISTENCE OF A SUPREME BEING. We find that it is true that he has had many conceptions and imaginations
            regarding what he has thought and NOW thinks Yahweh or “God” is, hence, the rise of the Polytheistic,
            Pantheistic and Monotheistic conceptions of Yahweh. These are about the oldest theories which attempt to
            explain and impart some KNOWLEDGE of the Great Elohim and Creator of the Universe.

        <p class="ti">
            Many new religious theories are being born every year while millions of people throughout the world are
            becoming more and more confused. As heretofore stated, some have given up the SEARCH FOR YAHWEH in despair,
            professing to be skeptics, atheists, agnostics and infidels. They take this attitude because they are unable
            to FIND YAHWEH for themselves or reconcile themselves to honestly BELIEVE in the UNKNOWN Elohim and the
            dogmatic religious philosophy and deception of the masses. Others are pressing on, leaving no stone
            unturned, honestly searching for Yahweh with renewed determination. Among this group are some of the world’s
            most brilliant academically trained scientists. Many of these scientists, equipped with an expansion of
            intelligence and new or recently improved mechanical instruments, are laboring in every field of modern
            research. They are attempting to further explore the material and psychical realm, hoping to FIND YAHWEH,
            and solve the unexplained, mysterious RIDDLE of the Universe.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It is generally believed that when the TRUE YAHWEH is UNIVERSALLY KNOWN as He actually EXISTS, all strife,
            confusion, bloodshed, poverty, sickness and death will utterly banish from the earth. With this glorious
            thought in mind many of these scientists have defied death. Some have lost or freely given their lives
            trying to wrest the fundamental SECRET OF LIFE from the Universe for the benefit of suffering humanity. For
            example, what about Astronautical Space Invasion and Oceanography? Failing to understand the secret
            manifestation of Elohim in the material realm, many trained psychologists have turned their attention to the
            psychical realm. These trained investigations and carefully planned experiments, although not yet complete
            in every detail, have led to the birth and establishment of the “New Psychological Religions” of the past
            few years. It would be a serious mistake to confuse this “New Philosophical Psychology” with the OLD
            MATERIALISTIC PSYCHOLOGY. They are as far removed from each other as the Planets. Let us pause here and
            briefly review some of the basic teaching of the “New Psychology.”

            THE BASIC TEACHING OF THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            (Author’s Note: We will use the Title “God” through this article for understanding and clarity of
            explanation.)
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            From what I am able to understand, many of these modern, academically trained famous psychologists have
            already gone on record “BELIEVING and TEACHING” that GOD is a three-fold MIND. They do not all call the
            major part of the great MIND by the same name. It is also true that they do not all agree on a few minor
            details involved in the ramified functions of this great “MIND”, but on the main issues at hand they are
            well agreed. Some of their presumptions are as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (1) There is presumed to be a “CONSCIOUS MIND” in existence. It is supposed to operate through the Senses —
            sight, taste, touch, smell, hearing, etc. The Conscious Mind is referred to as the vibratory or creative
            “Thought Chamber” of the physical body where “Ideas” are formed. Hence, all “Voluntary” functions of our
            physical bodies and everything else connected with our material existence is said to be under the direct
            control of the “CONSCIOUS MIND.” This means that our homes, our business and all other Conscious functions
            of our bodies are controlled or conducted by the “Conscious Mind.” There are other functions attributed to
            the “Conscious Mind,” but neither time or space will permit us to discuss them here.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) There is also presumed to be a “SUBCONSCIOUS MIND” in existence. The SUBCONSCIOUS MIND and the CONSCIOUS
            MIND are said to be joined together. The Subconscious Mind has no Conscience. Therefore, it is claimed that
            the Subconscious Mind is NOT a respecter of persons. We are also informed that the great Subconscious Mind
            is far more ethereal and powerful in its operations than the Conscious Mind. It is said to have complete
            charge and control of all “Involuntary” bodily functions such as breathing, heartbeat and the digestion and
            assimilation of food, the building of new cells for reparation of the physical body and restoring of
            mentality, which has been impaired by illness or injury.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            The Subconscious Mind is presumed to be the source of great “Wisdom and Power.” We are told that there is
            nothing that it cannot or will not do, once its wisdom and power has been invoked. It receives Ideas, which
            are sent down to it by the Conscious Mind. We are informed that once an idea is registered in the
            Subconscious Mind, it will leave no stone unturned until it has brought into actual manifestation the things
            which are laid upon it to do. Further, it is claimed that many cases of diseases, heretofore pronounced
            incurable by Medical Science, have been miraculously healed. We are told that the lame have been made to
            walk and sight restored to the blind. The new discoveries of scientists and inventors — the successful
            career of professional and business persons, the rising in rank of the ordinary people and the accumulation
            of wealth in abundance and supreme happiness, all is said to be the Materialization of Ideas impressed upon
            the great SUBCONSCIOUS MIND.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (3) Still Deeper Down there is presumed to be a “UNIVERSAL MIND” in existence. The Universal Mind and the
            Subconscious Mind are said to be joined together. Instead of referring to this MIND as the UNIVERSAL MIND,
            some of the psychologists call it the great “OVERSOUL,” COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS,” SUPER CONSCIOUSNESS,”
            SUPERSONIC MIND,” SUBLIMINAL MIND,” INFINITE MIND,” etc. In fact there are over one hundred and seventy
            different scientific and professional names that have been applied to the major operation part of this great
            “MIND.”
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Nevertheless, the name “UNIVERSAL MIND” is very popular and quite frequently used by many of the modern
            psychologists. It is supposed to be the “GREAT MASTER MIND” of the Universe that embraces and sustains all
            LIFE, whether it be vegetable, animal, human or otherwise. In fact, we are told by some psychologists, that
            every Cosmic phase of nature is some or other expression of the great “UNIVERSAL MIND.” Moreover, it is said
            to be infinite in “INTELLIGENCE, WISDOM and POWER.” Therefore, it is from the “Universal Mind,” that the
            Subconscious Mind draws or receives its wisdom and power. Further, we are told that it is, within itself,
            far more ethereal and powerful in its functions and operations than the Subconscious Mind. Whereas, the
        </p>

        <p>
            multifarious ramifications of the great Universal Mind are far too complicated to even attempt to fully
            explain herein.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Nevertheless, the determination of these modern psychologists in their effort to “Find and know God,” is not
            to be ignored or taken in a passive way. The academically trained, scientific psychologists of today are far
            too wise to form definite opinions or reach final conclusions before exhausting every means of scientific
            research within their power to command. Therefore their disclosures demand the respect and serious attention
            of the public. However, many of these psychologists are not thoroughly satisfied in every respect with their
            present understanding and knowledge of the Psychical Realm, but they have not given up the search in
            despair. The progress is slow, but the “Search” still continues to press on towards the cherished goal.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            To briefly summarize the present paramount objectives of the exponents of the “New Psychological Religions”
            of today, they are still trying to further penetrate and explore the “Psychical Realm,” analyze and give a
            concise, understandable definition of what the combined Conscious, Subconscious and Universal Mind really
            “IS” — accurately describe or explain the fundamental PRINCIPLES involved in the classifications and the
            ramified, departmental functions of this three-fold “MIND.”
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            If, and when this task is accomplished, they hope and fully expect to discover the “ONE” and “ONLY” true
            “God” and Creator of the Universe. Know WHERE, WHEN, WHY or WHAT, He really IS. They fully expect to learn
            and understand His Manifestations, invoke His Almighty Power, freely partake of His infinite Wisdom and
            Intelligence, which will enable them to Reveal His identity to the masses. Thus, in this way, they, like the
            rest of the great scientific and philosophical minded leaders, hope to completely abolish forever, the
            present prevailing stupendous ignorance of His ever Presence — and lift the nations of the earth plane out
            of the quagmire of Ritualism and Religious Deception and become permanently established in Universal
            Righteousness, Peace and Joy, which IS THE TRUE KINGDOM OF “GOD” (<a

            FAILURE OF THE MODERN - NEW PSYCHOLOGICAL RELIGIONS
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            These modern Psychologists have gone a long way up the road through their investigations of the Psychical
            Realm. They have come close to “finding” the ETERNAL, LIVING CREATOR. However, they have made three great
            mistakes that have impeded the progress: (1) their failure to use the Divine-given Pattern (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=25#v40">Exodus 25:40</a>;
            <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=58&chapter=8#v5">Hebrews 8:5</a>), (2) that of leaving the Biblical,
            Messianic definition of “God” (ELOHIM IS SPIRIT - <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=4#v24">John
                4:24</a>), in the background, and (3) believing and teaching that there is a UNIVERSAL MIND, instead of
            a Universal Spirit.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Acknowledgment is made without hesitation that there are many modern schools of this kind and a great number
            of teachers in the world that are far more capable than this author to intelligently expound their views on
            this and other secular subjects. Nevertheless, up to this present time they have been unable to impart a
            clear, concise and understandable definition of what the great intangible and ethereal, so-called
            “Conscious, Subconscious and Universal Mind” REALLY IS; neither have they proven by the Divine Pattern, that
            it is what they think or say that it is.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Psychologists and teachers have failed to point out and thoroughly explain WHERE, WHEN and HOW the
            Conscious, Subconscious and Universal Minds really work in relation to each other sufficiently for persons
            of average intelligence to conscientiously recognize (HIS or) ITS presence and sincerely appreciate its
            benefits. Neither have they successfully proven that this great ethereal, so-called Universal Mind possessed
            the infinite POWER of systematical materialization or transmutation in totality or in either of its two
            distinctive parts. (By transmutation or metamorphosis, I mean — the POWER or POSSIBILITY OF MANIFESTATION or
            apparent change from one substance, form, nature or species into another, and in the process of these series
            of changes, maintain perfect and absolute control in each and every phase or state of existence). From what
            we are told of the Universal and Subconscious Mind, both are far too limited to

            COMPARATIVE EXEGETICAL ANALYSIS
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            Mind is most frequently associated with the mental state of a human being, according to reputable
            lexicographers. Therefore, Mind is constantly subject to fluctuating changes, for better or worse, but not
            so in the case of “God” or Spirit (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=43&chapter=4#v24">John 4:24</a>) as He
            said, “For I am Yahweh, I CHANGE NOT” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=39&chapter=3#v6">Malachi 3:6</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Dr. Hugo Munsterburg, the former Dean of Psychology at Harvard University, made the statement that there is
            no such thing as a Subconscious Mind in existence. Here and now I make the unconditional statement that
            Yahweh IS NOT a Subconscious or Universal Mind. Instead, Yahweh is “ALL IN ALL.” That is to say, Yahweh IS
            (the eternal three-fold) Universal SPIRIT, possessing the power of transmutation in His two manifestations,
            Incorporeal and Physical. But in the absence of a clear, understandable definition and explanation of what
            SPIRIT REALLY IS, and how it operates, we are still compelled to remain in ignorance or jeopardy. In the
            pure literal sense of the word, SPIRIT IS ABSTRACT. But in the true divine, etymological, concrete sense
            SPIRIT is the “ALL IN ALL” or the “Terminus Ad Quem” of whom a direct and profound knowledge is not claimed.
            The expression, Terminus Ad Quem, refers to Yahweh in His Abstract State or without form, being the “limit
            and bounds” of every conceivable and inconceivable idea of Source and Substance, Wisdom and Intelligence,
            Knowledge and Power, Law and Justice, Love and Mercy, Beauty and Glory.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            In the Abstract sense, absolutely nothing could exist before or independent of SPIRIT. Neither can anything
            with or without shape or form be pre-existent or co-eternal with SPIRIT. Therefore, as we have already said,
            Yahweh in this state of existence is PURE SPIRIT or ABSTRACTION. But Yahweh, in the process of taking on
            FORM or moving in part from the abstract into intermediate state, conceived the idea of the Concrete
            CREATION and the desire to manifest or make Himself KNOWN to His Creatures of the Creation. Now, as
            Yahweh-Elohim existed in FORM before He began His work of CREATION, He is, therefore, the true three-fold
            ARCHETYPAL (SPIRIT) PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE.”
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Inasmuch as Elohim, in this INTERMEDIATE STATE is the true, original INCORPOREAL PATTERN and SPIRIT LAW by
            which the invisible and visible parts of the Universe or creation must be systematically FORMED and given
            LIFE, He must possess (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=20&chapter=8#v22">Proverbs 8:22</a>) both masculine
            and feminine generative organs (or the space of the
            Universe containing everything) within His SPIRIT EMBODIMENT. Likewise, Elohim Himself, the immaculate
            essence or substance, energy or life, and the IMMUTABLE LAW, intelligently manifesting Himself or apparently
            transmuted, in part, into both the INVISIBLE and VISIBLE counter-parts of the Universe.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Hence, the Universe in its totality, which expression includes every CREATED object or thing, visible and
            invisible, animate and inanimate, known and unknown to be in existence, MUST DERIVE FROM and ABIDE WITHIN
            HIS GREAT “SPIRIT EMBODIMENT” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=44&chapter=17#v28">Acts 17:28</a>) herein
            called the ORIGINAL “INCORPOREAL PATTERN” whereby and
            wherein ALL created things are formed, shaped, animated and constantly controlled thereafter with unerring
            accuracy by the inviolable and immutable “SPIRlT LAW”, which is a part of the great Universal INCORPOREAL
            PATTERN.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Now as the Universal Creation (a term comprising the whole system of created things) cannot exist
            independent of “SPIRIT,” it is therefore, embodied in SPIRIT and DIVIDED into two distinctive parts, the
            INVISIBLE CREATION and the VISIBLE CREATION. Thus, the invisible and visible parts of the Universe are the
            TWO transmuted parts of the great Invisible Yahweh, manifesting Himself through the Universal Creation. Here
            it is not meant that Yahweh in PRINCIPLE is changeable, but by means of the Creation the MANIFESTATION of
            Elohim is multiplied and understood through the Realm of Nature. Hence, this leaves mankind totally without
            a legitimate excuse for NOT KNOWING YAHWEH AS HE REALLY EXISTS.

            may BE KNOWN of Yahweh IS MANIFEST in them; for Elohim hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of
            Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His
            eternal power and Supernal Nature; so that they are without excuse.” To a certain degree, Paul’s view is
            very definitely confirmed by modern science through experimental Atomic Research and philosophical
            expression. This should furnish us with sufficient ontological proof that it is TRUE that every cosmic phase
            of Nature, visible and ultra microscopic, animate and inanimate, organic and inorganic is but some or
            another expression of the great invisible, three-fold Yahweh-Elohim (<a
                href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1-John-Chapter-5/#7" target="_blank">I John 5:7, K.J.V.</a>).
            Viewing the facts before us we wonder why it should be necessary for us to pause here and set up delicate
            mechanical instruments and register “VIBRATIONS,” or make high powered microscopic investigations, trying to
            discover
            and prove the origin of MATTER in defense of this inescapable TRUTH.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It is already known and scientifically proven that MATTER, in its so-called inanimate and inorganic state,
            MUST and DOES DERIVE from some definite SOURCE and previously existing, infinite SUBSTANCE. As far as it is
            now known there is no prospective possibility of “Physical Visualization” of the “Source” or the original
            “Substance” from which MATTER is derived. Nevertheless, if it was Yahweh’s intention to manifest Himself in
            His Abstract, Intermediate and Concrete States of existence through the Universal Creation, then the SOURCE
            and the SUBSTANCE from which MATTER derived should not be too hard for us to determine. We should be able to
            solve this problem by plain, simple and logical deduction because of seven cardinal facts which are as
            follows:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (1) If there is an ETERNAL YAHWEH or SUPERNAL NATURE in existence, which we know there is, then NATURE
            should embrace and MANIFEST some permanent indisputable evidence of His everpresence. (However, we shall let
            the students make their own decisions on this score, from the evidence presented herein. See charts on
            creation, day by day in logical sequence found elsewhere in this volume).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) If it is true that Yahweh did exist as I have said, first in the “Abstract State;” that is to say, He
            first existed as PURE SPIRIT and WITHOUT FORM OR CREATIVE MOTION, then if Yahweh wished to manifest Himself,
            the SOURCE and the SUBSTANCE in the CREATION, MATTER MUST BE the direct “VIBRATION or MATERIALIZATION” of
            SPIRIT and appear first in the INANIMATE and INORGANIC state or WITHOUT FORM and VOID of vegetable, animal
            or human life.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (3) If it is true that Yahweh did move from the Abstract to the Intermediate state; that is to say, HE DID
            exist in SUPER INCORPOREAL FORM first, before direct, concentrated, CREATIVE MOTION was established by His
            immutable SPIRIT LAW, then MATTER, in its organic and animated state, or in FORM and demonstration of
            vegetable, animal or human life, must be the direct, systematical TRANSMUTATION OF SPIRIT (<a
                href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v11__20">Genesis 1:11-31</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (4) If it is TRUE that MATTER is (A) the materialization and (B) the transmutation of SPIRIT, then the
            complete structure of each ATOMIC ELEMENT of matter as well as the entire molecular and true cosmographical
            structure of the PHYSICAL CREATION should manifest the existence of the Unity of the Spirit. But we refuse
            to leave the analysis of matter and the solution of this technical problem up to the bias and untrained
            philosophical, carnal mind of modern skeptics.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            We must, therefore, refer our first problem which is (A) the STRUCTURE OF THE SUPERNAL NATURE OR “GODHEAD”
            to the Divine Authorities. Likewise, we must refer our second problem which is (B) the STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
            to the practical, scientific authorities. Our paramount objective here is to carefully compare the structure
            of the ATOM to that of the “GODHEAD” and also the ATOM to the VISIBLE and INVISIBLE parts of the UNIVERSE,
            both of which are embodied in Yahweh and controlled with unerring accuracy by UNIVERSAL SPIRIT LAW. Hence,
            the Divine and scientific, authentic explanations are as follows:

        <p class="ti">
            (5) The Divine Authority on the Structure of the “Godhead.” The Apostle John said, “For there are THREE that
            bear record in HEAVEN, the FATHER, the WORD, and the HOLY SPIRIT: and these THREE ARE ONE” (<a

            embodied in the total structure of the physical CREATION is derived from UNIVERSAL SPIRIT.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            In the material realm of NATURE these Ninety-One, three-fold, ATOMIC ELEMENTS OF MATTER, systematically
            FORMED by UNIVERSAL SPIRIT LAW, apparently present sufficient concrete evidence to support the existence of
            the three-fold Supernal Nature or “Godhead”, Likewise, the HYDROGEN ATOM (herein classified), the
            Ninety-Second and only TWO-FOLD ATOMIC ELEMENT OF MATTER, clearly manifests that the UNIVERSE is composed of
            TWO distinctive parts, namely: (1) the INVISIBLE or INCORPOREAL CREATION and (2) the VISIBLE or MATERIAL
            CREATION. These are the TWO transmuted parts of the three-fold Supernal Nature or “Godhead.”
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            The apparent total absence of a THIRD part in the two-fold HYDROGEN ATOM as related to the three-fold
            Supernal Nature or “Godhead” and the two-fold Universe also has a very important significance. It reveals
            that the Invisible or Incorporeal and the Visible or Material parts of the UNIVERSE are embodied in
            UNIVERSAL SPIRIT, or the major Invisible THIRD part of the Supernal Nature or “Godhead.” Wherein both are
            accurately and unerringly controlled by Universal SPIRIT LAW.

            To help you better understand our point of view and the explanation given in the foregoing paragraphs we
            present a few questions and suggested answers. The questions are as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (1) What IS IT that caused the ethereal “SPACE” of the Universe to EXIST and constantly remain intact?
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) What caused the PLANETS to EXIST and operate in space with centrifugal force and unerring accuracy,
            within their orbit, constantly bringing about day and night and the seasons of Spring, Summer, Fall and
            Winter, year after year?
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (3) What caused the “SEEDS” of vegetation to EXIST and grow into fruition in abundance and repeated
            productivity year after year?
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (4) What caused the “ORNITHOLOGICAL” (or bird) KINGDOM to EXIST and to KNOW HOW to fly; build nests; lay
            eggs, hatch and properly care for their offspring?
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (5) What caused all other living creatures of the Amphibious Plane (water and land) to EXIST and constantly
            control their disposition, activities and final destiny?
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            In considering the suggested answers your attention can be focused again on the heretofore stated concept of
            MIND, since many of our modern, academically trained, scientific psychologists would have us believe that
            there is a UNIVERSAL MIND in existence. They also tell us that the UNIVERSAL MIND has TWO parts; the
            SUBCONSCIOUS MIND and the CONSCIOUS MIND. Further, they would have us believe that the UNIVERSAL MIND is
            directly responsible for the EXISTENCE of the Universe; that everything in the Universe is accurately
            controlled by CONSCIOUS MIND, through impressions that are transferred to and executed by the SUBCONSCIOUS
            MIND.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Now, can we safely conclude and rest assured that the so-called UNIVERSAL MIND and its TWO parts are
            directly responsible for the EXISTENCE OF SPACE and infallible control of the planets, seeds, birds and
            other living creatures of this earth plane? Personally, I do not think so. Why? Because of THREE
            fundamental, undisputable FACTS which are as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (1) No one ever has or can put forth sufficient concrete, Divine and material proof that there is in
            existence an INTANGIBLE three-fold UNIVERSAL MIND possessed with the infinite power of total or partial
            systematical materialization and transmutation.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) No one can prove that the AGREED THOUGHT VIBRATION and FINAL CONCLUSIONS of all living creatures
            originating in the CONSCIOUS MIND and impressed upon the so-called SUBCONSCIOUS MIND ever did or can CHANGE
            or OBSTRUCT the circumscribed course of NATURE. In other words, the immutable, inviolable or unobstructable
            SPIRIT LAW that controls NATURE cannot be changed by our thought vibrations and final conclusions impressed
            upon the so-called SUBCONSCIOUS or UNIVERSAL MIND.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (3) Here lies the ANSWER and TRUE FACTS in the case. The very existence of the UNIVERSE, itself, and limited
            scientific KNOWLEDGE of its cosmographical structure and perpetual operation of its “Incorporeal and
            Material” parts actually proves that it is DERIVED from UNIVERSAL SPIRIT, and that it IS controlled with
            unerring accuracy by inviolable and unobstructable SPIRIT LAW. For example: Man, from his very earliest
            inception until this present time, cannot

            point out ONE single error or miscarriage of this infallible and ALMIGHTY SPIRIT LAW.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Year after year the planets still continue to operate in the same way, constantly bringing about day and
            night and the seasons of the year: Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. By no possible chance or error have they
            ever been removed from their orbit, bumped into each other and exchanged day for night or disrupted the
            primordial order of the seasons. It is possible that “phenomenon” heretofore unknown to mankind may appear
            to us in or among the Heavenly bodies for the first time in history; but no one can proclaim with
            justification, or prove that this phenomenal parade in the ethereal space of the Universe is an error or
            miscarriage of the Universal SPIRIT LAW, because heretofore it was only our IGNORANCE of this presence and
            the true fundamental principles involved in the operation. Neither can anyone truthfully say that the
            “thought vibrations” of ALL living creatures impressed upon the, presumed to exist, SUBCONSCIOUS MIND had
            anything to do with their existence, categorical operation, and timely phenomenal manifestation.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            This very same immutable SPIRIT LAW which formed and caused the seed of the fruit and vegetable kingdoms to exist, controls the survival and perpetuation of these “kingdoms” through the Ages by the direct process of periodical maturity and reproduction. But MIND, whatsoever IT IS said to BE, had absolutely nothing to do with the origin of the SEEDS or the mathematical calculation as to how many different varieties there was to be in existence, nor their natural characteristics and adaptation to environments. For example: The farmer plants the seed in the “GROUND” and goes away and lets it alone. His concentrated “THOUGHT VIBRATIONS and IMPRESSIONS upon his, presumed to exist, SUBCONSCIOUS MIND will not effect the productive capacities or quality of the seed or promote the maturity of the fruit and vegetables. However, after he plants his seeds he lets them alone and, if NOT OTHERWISE OBSTRUCTED, they will grow into fruition in abundance. At this point let us completely remove the farmer from the case and discuss the seed and the ground.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Now, can it be truthfully said that the seeds of vegetation are CONSCIOUS of the fact that they are planted and they KNOW HOW to appeal their case to the so-called powerful, ramified activity of the SUBCONSCIOUS MIND to rear them to maturity? Or is the ground CONSCIOUS of the fact that the seed is planted therein and IT immediately begins to involve the activity of the SUBCONSCIOUS MIND to nurse the seeds to fruition? Let us recapitulate. Both YOU and I KNOW that MIND has absolutely nothing to do with what takes place on the part of the seeds themselves or the ground in which the seeds are planted. For example, several comparisons with the three-fold Supernal Nature (Godhead) and the so-called “Great Master Mind” of the Universe, etc. shall be made:

            Let us reconsider the ornithological (or bird) kingdom as included among the “living creatures”. Who taught the birds HOW to fly and sing? WHEN, WHERE and HOW were they instructed to build their nests, lay their eggs, hatch and properly care for their offspring? No one taught the birds the sense of direction; yet, in moving about from place to place according to the seasons of the year, their destination is a foregone conclusion. By no possible chance or error have they flown in the wrong direction and found themselves lost far out over the Pacific Ocean, or perhaps exhausted and stranded somewhere in the icy waste lands of Labrador or the sun-baked sands of the Sahara Desert. At no time have they ever laid their eggs and hatched a nest of flying squirrels. The infallible “spirit law” governing their existence never fools them or us in any sense of the word.

            Consider one of the most incredible, instinctive dispositions manifested in the world of nature, the spawning of fish. Salmon will travel hundreds and hundreds of miles, pressing onward to reach their particular ancestral spawning stream. There and there alone will they give birth to new generations of salmon.
